It's just like heaven being here with you
You're like an angel, too good to be true
But after all, I love you, I do
Angel baby, my angel baby

When you are near me, my heart skips a beat
I can hardly stand on my own two feet
Because I love you, I love you, I do
Angel baby, my angel baby

Ooh, I love you, ooh I do
No one could love you like I do

Please never leave me blue and alone
If you ever go, I'm sure you'll come back home
Because I love you, I love you, I do
Angel baby, my angel baby

It's just like heaven being with you dear
I can never stay without you near
Because I love you, I love you, I do
Angel baby, my angel baby

Ooh, I love you, ooh I do
No one could love you like I do
