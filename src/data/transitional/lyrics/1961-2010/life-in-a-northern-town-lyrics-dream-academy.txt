A Salvation Army band played
And the children drank lemonade
And the morning lasted all day, all day
And through an open window came
Like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away, ah

Ah hey, ma ma ma
Life in a northern town

They sat on the stony ground
And he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down to listen
He said, "In winter 1963
It felt like the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy and the Beatles"

Ah hey, ma ma ma
Life in a northern town
Ah hey, ma ma ma
All the work shut down

The evening had turned to rain
Watch the water roll down the drain
As we followed him down to the station
And though he never would wave goodbye
You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight, bye-bye

Ah hey, ma ma ma
Life in a northern town
Ah hey, ma ma ma
Life in a northern town
