I saw you standing and I felt your rage
Like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl I know what to believe

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You wanna run away don't care where you go
You wanna run away, run away that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie

You're living in dreamtime baby
It's time to wake up
You're living in dreamtime baby
It's time to shape up

In your dream it's overcast
Rain comes down movin' your way fast
You wanna run away don't care where you go
You wanna run away, run away that's all you know

You turn a corner then you see a door
Walk on through throw, lay yourself on the floor
When you're looking up it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with movie star eyes

You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie

You're living in dreamtime baby
It's time to wake up
You're living on dreamtime baby
It's time to shape up, shape up

You're living in dreamtime
You're living in dreamtime
Wanna run away, run away

You're living in dreamtime baby
Shape up
You're living on dreamtime baby
It's time to wake up

I never saw anybody fall apart so fast
Living in dreamtime you know it ain't gonna last
Never saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong
Living in dreamtime, it's hard to carry on, yeah

You wanna run away
Run away, baby
You wanna run away
Run away

I never saw anybody fall apart so fast
I hope it won't last
Never saw anybody think she's so right and be so wrong
Dreamtime, it's hard to carry on

Dreamtime, dreamtime
Run away
Dreamtime, dreamtime
Run away
