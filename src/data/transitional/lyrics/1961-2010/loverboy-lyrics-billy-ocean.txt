I don't know what you've got but it plays with my emotions
I want you so much, darling, I want to hold you near
Want to whisper sweet and tender in your ear

Can't stand the thought of you with somebody else
Got to have your love, got to have it all to myself
I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

I wanna be your lover, lover
wanna be your lover, lover, loverboy
Lover, lover, yeah
Wanna be your lover, lover, loverboy

I'm too far gone, it's hard to stop, baby, you're my dream in motion
And I won't give up, teasin' me with your fire
My finger's on the trigger, you're the one I desire

'Cause I get this feeling, feeling from nobody else
Gotta have your tenderness all to myself
I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Wanna be your lover, lover
wanna be your lover, lover, loverboy
Lover, lover, yeah
Wanna be your lover, lover, ooh yeah

And I want you really but the thing is there's nothing I can say
To stop you darling from running, running away
Won't you stay, stay, stay?

I wanna be your lover, lover, yeah
I wanna be your lover, lover
I wanna be your love
I gotta be your love

I wanna be your love
And I can stand it, baby
Girl, I love you more and more each day
