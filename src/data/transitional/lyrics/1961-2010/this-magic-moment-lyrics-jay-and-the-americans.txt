This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you

And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes

Sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)
Softer than a summer night
(Softer than a summer night)
Everything I wanna have
(Everything, everything)
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
(This magic moment)
While your lips are close to mine will last forever
Forever till the end of time
(This magic moment)
This magic moment

Sweeter than wine
(Sweeter than wine)
Softer than a summer night
(Softer than a summer night)
Everything I wanna have
(Everything, everything)
Whenever I hold you tight

This magic moment
(This magic moment)
While your lips are close to mine will last forever
Forever till the end of time
(This magic moment)

Magic, magic, magic
Moment
Magic, magic, magic
Moment

Magic, magic, magic
Moment
Magic
