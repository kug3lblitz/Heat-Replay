You never tried me, always stood right by me
Make living lively highly spoken of my only love, the only one
You're my wifey make my life complete, sweet
But you know when to flip it street, freak
But only when it comes to me, see that's why you're my wifey

This you should know
'Cause you had my mind blown, ohh, ohh
Full of junk at the club on bump, like what
I had to have you, babe
Saw you outside, passenger side
'Cause I let my best friend drive, you was in line
That's when you caught my eyes, girl

You were so beautiful, girl
It was so critical, girl
You looked so crucial, girl
Something about you is everything, you are mine

You never tried me, always stood right by me
Make living lively highly spoken of my only love, the only one
You're my wifey make my life complete, sweet
But you know when to flip it street, freak
But only when it comes to me, see that's why you're my wifey

You know you're sexy too
I like your attitude, I ain't even mad at you
Girl, you're still my boo
Either braids or weave, skirt or jeans
You're still my queen
Baby girl go do your thing
I'm so glad you're on my team

You are so beautiful, girl
It is so critical, girl
You looked so crucial, girl
Something about you is everything, you are mine

You never tried me, always stood right by me
Make living lively highly spoken of my only love, the only one
You're my wifey make my life complete, sweet
But you know when to flip it street, freak
But only when it comes to me, see that's why you're my wifey

Someone, I can spend my life with
Leave the keys to the Benz, wedding band with your gems
You're someone, I feel all right with
Someone to have my kids, someone I can depend on

You never tried me, always stood right by me
Make living lively highly spoken of my only love, the only one
You're my wifey make my life complete, sweet
But you know when to flip it street, freak
But only when it comes to me, see that's why you're my wifey

Skinny designer fit real jiggy
Ain't afraid to hump with me when we get busy
Ride out I licky-licky, 'till I get dizzy
Toes done, fresh scent, I think it's sizzy
Hose none, she's the one who was down with me
Used to struggle, now we bubble, count the G's with me
Pop the champagne, let's take a sippy-sippy
Describe you I try to you're my wifey

Will you be my wifey?
(Yes, I'll be your wifey)
Say you'll be my wifey, girl
(Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea)
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes I'll be your wifey)
Oh! Say you'll be my wifey, girl
(Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea)
