Here we are face to face
With the memories that can't be erased
Although we need each other
Things have changed, it's not the same

Sometimes it makes me wonder
Where would I be
If you hadn't discovered which I did
Inside of me I know there was something
That we could compare

Oh, well, I never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well I, only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life

Remembering the good times
From a portrait hung on high
It's filled with so much color
And the laughter we left behind

I made the choice and you couldn't decide
I made the choice, I was wrong you were right
Deep down inside, I apologize

Never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well I, only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life

Well, I never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well I, only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life

Though I made plans with you
To always have time for you
Before you walk out of my life
I guess it's true, cannot live without you
Don't ever go away, ooh oh yeah

Never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well I, only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life

Never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life

Never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life
Before you walk out of my life
