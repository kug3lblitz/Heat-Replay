So women come frequent like flight mileage

But I ain't gon' sweat ya, baby

Catch up wit' ya game
Run faster
But don't let 'em lose ya
'cause I ain't gon' bless ya
Unless ya
Feel a lil' desperate
Send a nigga a text message, girl

Stop!
Wait a minute
the way you move that girl,
you done got my heart all in it
And I just wanna be with you tonight (girl, please)
I'm a playa, yeah, it's true
But I change the game for you
I wanna see what it do

Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Oh ya, just my type
Everything's so right
And I just wanna chill
So let's dip up out of here

This just ain't no game, these just ain't words
(That I'm spittin')
If you could see the thoughts that's in my head
I'm trippin'
I'm a playa, yeah, it's true
But I change the game for you
I wanna see what it do (do)

Can I be for real?

So let's dip up out of here
Oh ya, just my type
Everything's so right

Weezy F baby, the key to the ladies
Keys to the 'cedes, but please say the baby
Weed and Patron even in the A.M.
We should be alone, we can get a day in
Ya like what I'm sayin'?
Then come around the way and
We can go inside and stay in
Tell the homeboy ya stayin'
You've been taken
Gone
Turn me on, and I'm a turn him, ya'
You know I love you like cooked food
You know you fuckin' wit' a good dude
You know you give good brain

You know I'm a good move
So you should do (me)
So, hey, shawty, what it is?
The Carter who it is
Now, shawty, do it big
A party at my crib
That's a party in the hills
You call it what you want
But she gon' call it when she feels
(Ow!)

Can I be for real?
This is how I feel
I'm in need of love
So let's dip up out of here
Oh ya, just my type
Everything's so right
And I just wanna chill
