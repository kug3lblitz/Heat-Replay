Ladies and gents
Turn up your sound systems
To the sound of Carlos Santana
In the GMB ghetto blues
From the refugee camps

Oh Maria, Maria
She remind me of a West Side story
Growin' up in Spanish Harlem
She livin' a life just like a movie star

Oh Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar yeah yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

Stop the lootin', stop the shootin'
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer

Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinkin' of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Somebody just said, "See you later"
Yeah

Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula
(East Coast)
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula

Maria, Maria
(West Coast)
She remind me of a West Side story
Growin' up in Spanish Harlem
She livin' a life just like a movie star

Oh Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
I said it to the sounds of the guitar yeah yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

I said a la favella, los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to putout the fire
Mi canto la esperanza

Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinkin' of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hopin' the days of paradise

Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula
(North side)
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula
(South side)

Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula
(Worldwide)
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula
(Open up your eyes)

Maria you know you're my lover
When the wind blows I can feel you
Through the weather and even when we're apart
It still feels like we're together

Maria, oh yeah
She remind me of a West Side story
Growin' up in Spanish Harlem
She livin' a life just like a movie star

Oh Maria, Maria
Oh, she fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar
Played by Carlos Santana

Put 'em up y'all
Carlos Santana with the refugee camp
Wyclef, Jerry "Wonder"
Mr. Santana, GMB
Yo, Carlos man, you makin' that guitar cry
