I said I would get over you
Now I'm here out on my own trying to live my life
And now you wanna come back
But I don't need no brand new lies, listen up

I want a love that's serious
No time to play love games
I don't wanna be nobody's fool
So if you wanna be with me you gotta give it up

Real love, I know I wanna have one
Real love, gonna try and get some
Real love, everybody needs one
Real love, got to have real love

All my friends are telling me
