We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, Coleman, sleepin' bags
Some fishin' poles, a cooler of cokes
3 days before we had to be back

When your 7 and your in your 7th Heaven
Goin' campin' in the wild outdoors
As we turned off on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we'll have
Just me and you doin' what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy around, this is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old vette
I thought that boy would go insane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around 4 spinning wheels
We're not zoned in till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel

He said, "Dad this could be the best day of my life"
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we'll have
Just me and you doin' what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy around, this is the best day of my life

Standin' in the middle of the room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Lookin' at him I said
"I can't believe son that you've grown"

He said, "Dad this could be the best day of my life"
I've been dreamin' day and night about bein' like you
That's me and her watching you and mom, I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive, this is the best day of my life
I'm the luckiest man alive, this is the best day of my life
