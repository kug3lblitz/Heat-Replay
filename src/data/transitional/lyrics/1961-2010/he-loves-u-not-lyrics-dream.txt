Give it your all girl, give it all ya got
You can take your chance at a second hand shot
Say what you want girl, do what you do
He's never gonna, gonna make it with you

You're pulling petals off a flower trying to get your way
Keep pulling til' it says what you want it to say
Girl, you can pick a field full of daisies
But he'd still be my baby

I know, you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him
Instinctively, I know what you're thinking
You'll be giving him an open invitation
But my baby won't be taken in

You can pout your cherry lips
Try to tend him with a sweet kiss
You can flutt your pretty eyes
He ain't got his hands tied

No chains to unlock
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves u not

No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves u not

You're the kind of girl that is always up for do or dare
Only want him just because he's there
Always looking for a new ride
The grass is greener on the other side

You're the kind of girl who's not used to hearing no
All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go
It doesn't matter how hard you try
Never gonna get with my guy

No chains to unlock
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves u not

No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves u not

Doesn't matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you

Give it your all girl, give it all ya got
You can take your chance at a second hand shot
Say what you want girl, do what you do
He's never gonna make it with you

You can pout your cherry lips, yeah
Try to tend him with a sweet kiss
You can flutt your pretty eyes
He ain't got his hands tied

No chains to unlock
So free to do what he wants
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves u not

No matter what you do
He's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves u not
