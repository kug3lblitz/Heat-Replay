Baby, you come knocking on my front door
Same old line you used to use before
And I said yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?
I didn't know what I was getting into

So you've had a little trouble in town
Now you're keeping some demons down
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

It's hard to think about what you've wanted
It's hard to think about what you'd lost
This doesn't have to be the big get even
This doesn't have to be anything at all

I know you really want to tell me good-bye
I know you really want to be your own girl

Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

People running 'round loose in the world
Ain't got nothing better to do
Make a meal of some bright eyed kid
You need someone looking after you

I know you really want to tell me good-bye
I know you really want to be your own girl

Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
