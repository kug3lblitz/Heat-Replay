I keep gettin' closer to the love I know
I'm ready and willin', gettin' outta control
You win and you lose some, but if you stay in the game

Before you know it you feel the fire
But don't get burned by the flame
Oh, you'll find the answer any day

With every beat of my heart
I keep gettin closer to you
With every beat of my heart
Now I know we're gettin' closer to love
With every beat

Now, I just wanna know you more every day
And now it won't be long 'til I hear you say
Say that you do boy, it's just a matter of time

Before you know it you'll feel the fire
And it's burnin' deep inside
Oh, you'll find the answer in his eyes

With every beat of my heart
I keep gettin' closer to you
With every beat of my heart
Now I know we gettin' closer to love

With every beat of my heart
I feel you movin' closer to me
With every beat of my heart
Baby, I know it's becomin' reality
With every beat

Before you know it you feel the fire
But don't get burned by the flame
And oh, you'll find the answer any day

With every beat of my heart
I keep gettin' closer to you
With every beat of my heart
Now I know we're gettin' closer to love

With every beat of my heart
I feel you movin' closer to me
With every beat of my heart
Baby, I know it's becomin' reality

With every beat of my heart
I keep gettin' closer to you
With every beat of my heart
Now I know we're gettin' closer to love

With every beat of my heart
I feel you movin' closer to me
