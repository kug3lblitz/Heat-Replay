Sir luscious got gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's
And El Dorado's I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Ralo
So follow it's your time at the Apollo
Minus the kiki shepard what about a ho in a leopard print
Teddy pender grass cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left my throat warm in the dorm room at the AU
We do hey you and might do some cake too
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
'Cause

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm just so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm just so fresh so clean

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm just so fresh so clean

Canary yellow seven house of business on display
My nigga bungle whipped it up so I gone get my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the colorful hideout
I'm a show you how to wild out like Jack Trippa
Let me be bambino on your snippas
YKK on yo zippa lick you like a lizard
When I'm slizzard or sober six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah I get crews to choose and you get pretty deep
But I'll call yo ass round eightish I know you'll be there for me
'Cause

Those huge baby eyes get to runnin' off at they mouth
Tellin' me everything that's on yo nasty mind
They say your malnutrition in need of vitamin D
And inviting me to that tingle in yo' spines
I love who you are love who ya ain't you so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
With change and no chains and whips I do suck lips
Till hips jerk and double time the boy next door's a freak
Ha ha

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm just so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm just so fresh so clean

(And we are)
The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
(In my mind)
The sky is fallin' ain't no need to panic
(But oh oh)
I got a stick and want yo' automatic
(Oh oh oh)
Compatible created in the attic
