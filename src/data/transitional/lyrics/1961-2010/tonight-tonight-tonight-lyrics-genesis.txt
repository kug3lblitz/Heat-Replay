I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey but it's alright
Like a load on your back that you can't see but it's alright
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, just let it go, get it away from me

'Cos tonight, tonight, tonight, oh, I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I'm going down, going down like a monkey but it's alright
Try to pick yourself up, carry that weight that you can't see
Don't you know it's alright, it's like a helter skelter, going down
And down, round and round but just get it away from me, oh

Because tonight, tonight, tonight, oh, we're gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I got some money in my pocket, about ready to burn
I don't remember where I got it, I gotta get it to you
So please answer the phone 'cos I keep calling
But you're never home, what am I gonna do?

Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh, I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

You keep telling me I've got everything
You say I've got everything I want
You keep telling me you're gonna help me
You're gonna help me but you don't

But now I'm in too deep, you see it's got me
So that I just can't sleep, oh get me out of here
Please get me out of here, just help me, I'll do anything
Anything if you'll just help me get out of here

I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey but it's alright
It's like a load on your back that you can't see, don't you know
That it's alright, just try to shake it loose, cut it free, let it go
But just get it away from me

'Cos tonight, tonight, tonight, oh, maybe we'll make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

Please get me out of here, someone get me out of here
Just help me I'll do anything, anything if you'll just help
Get me out of here

Tonight, oh, I'm gonna make it right, tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
Yes tonight, tonight, tonight, oh, yes I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh
