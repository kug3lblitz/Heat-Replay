"Guess what I did today?"
Those were the words I said to you
It was last May, don't know the exact day
In my hand there was a ring

Then you told me that you loved me
More than anything in your life
So I asked you, would you do me
The honor of bein' my wife?

(Yes I will)
I will be your man
Your protector, your best friend
'Till my humble life is ended
And time begins again, couldn't we?

Couldn't we be, be happily ever after?
We could be strong together for so long
Couldn't we be, be happily ever after?
Leavin' you never 'til forever's gone

When I was away, hmm hmm
Some friends became just faces
Some people grew apart
But you stayed right in my heart

And so many times
Pictured this day inside my mind
And for so many years, ooh
I knew it would be you here with me, oh

(Yes I will)
Take you for my wife
The center of my life
And I will never, ever fade
From this choice I made, ooh oh

Couldn't we be, be happily ever after?
We could be strong together for so long
Couldn't we be, be happily ever after?
Leavin' you never 'til forever's gone

Hey yeah
You don't have to look no further than me
(Don't look no more, baby yeah)
You don't need much more than my lovin' to make you happy
(I'm so happy, I'm so happy babe)
Beneath the sight of God
I will make this vow to you
So come on baby
I'll be right here, stay with me
Said I'll be here baby, hey

Couldn't we be, be happily ever after?
We could be strong together for so long
Couldn't we be, be happily ever after?
Leavin' you never 'til forever's gone
(No, no, say no, no, I won't never leave you blue)

Couldn't we be, be happily ever after?
(You see today, I want to, to make you my wife)
We could be strong together for so long
(I want to spend all of my life)
Couldn't we be, be happily ever after?
(I will never leave, I will never go nowhere)
Leavin' you never 'til forever's gone
(Oh no, never hurt you)
