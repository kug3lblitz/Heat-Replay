New York girl, ooh ooh ooh

Runnin' pretty, New York City girl
Twenty-five, thirty-five
Hello baby, New York City girl

You grew up riding the subways running with people
Up in Harlem, down on Broadway
You're no tramp but you're no lady talkin' that street talk
You're the heart and soul of New York City

And love, love is just a passing word
It's the thought you had in a taxi cab
That got left on the curb
When he dropped you off at East 83rd

Oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh)
You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score by now
(You should know by now)
You're a native New Yorker

New York girl, ooh ooh ooh

Music plays, everyone's dancing closer and closer
Making friends and finding lovers
There you are lost in the shadows searching for someone
(Searchin' for someone)
To set you free from New York City

And, whoa, where did all those yesterdays go
When you still believed
Love could really be like a Broadway show
You are the star, win the applause

Oh oh oh
(Oh oh oh)
You're a native New Yorker
No one opens the door
For a native New Yorker

(Runnin' pretty, New York City girl)
Ooh ooh ooh
Native, native, native New Yorker

Where did all those yesterdays go
When you still believed
Love could really be like a Broadway show
You are the star

You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score by now
You're a native New Yorker

You should know the score
You should know the score by now
You're a native New Yorker, oh oh oh
(Native, native, native New Yorker)
You're a native New Yorker

Whoa, oh ho ho, you're a native New Yorker
You should know the score
(Native, native, native new Yorker)
You're a native New Yorker

What you waiting for, no one opens the door
(You're a native New Yorker)
For a native, for a native New Yorker
