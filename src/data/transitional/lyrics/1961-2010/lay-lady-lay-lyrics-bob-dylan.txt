Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed

Forget this dance, let's go upstairs
Let's take a chance, who really cares
Why don't you know, you got nothin' to prove
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs

Why wait any longer, I don't mean too complain?
You can have love but you might lose it
Why run any longer when you're runnin' in vain?
You can have the truth but you got to choose it

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
'Til the break of day, let me see you make him smile
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to hold you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay with you man awhile
