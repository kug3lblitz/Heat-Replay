I was a car hop, you were into the be-bop
You sang do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo
All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back again, well I know I'd never let you go
Back with all of my friends to that wonderful

'65 love affair, we wasn't gettin' nowhere
But we didn't care, it was a crazy
'65 love affair, rock 'n roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear, I can hear it, baby, yeah

Well, I acted like a dum-dum
You were bad with your pom-poms
We said, "Ooh-wah, go team, ooh-wah, go"
Ooh-ee baby, I want you to know

If I could go back in time, well I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind to that wonderful

'65 love affair when rock 'n roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear, I can hear it baby

Well, I tried to make you give in
One night at the drive-in
You said, "Oh-no baby, oh-no, whoo"
All of them changes you put me through

If I could go back in time, well, I know somehow you'd still be mine
I wouldn't be so blind to that wonderful

'65 love affair, we wasn't goin' nowhere
But we didn't care, it was a crazy
'65 love affair, rock 'n roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear, I can hear it, baby

We sang, do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo
Do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo
Do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo
Do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo

Do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo
Do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo
Do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo
Do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo
Do-wop-diddy, wop-diddy, wop-doo

If I could go back again, well I know our love would never end
Back with all of my friends to that wonderful

'65 love affair, rock 'n roll was simple and clear
Oh, I still can hear, I can hear it, baby
'65 love affair, we wasn't goin' nowhere
But we didn't care
