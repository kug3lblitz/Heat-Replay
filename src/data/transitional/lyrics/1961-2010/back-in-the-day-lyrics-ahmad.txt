Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days

When I just a little niggerole, I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so when he went out with girls
I could go taggin' along naggin' if she had a sis maybe
Could mack a baby hood rat

Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggaz singin' the blues
That be always tryin' to bag with the shag and karate shoes

Sayin', "Yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that"
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows

Then switch to playin' ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cuz they bell wearin' gazelles
If they really had money raised be sportin' Bk's

And, all the girls had they Turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school
Wish it'd blown up
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out
And be a grownup

But let me finish this reminescin' and tellin'
'Bout when girls was bellin' tight courderoys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eatin' pickles, with tootsie pops

And it don't stop, I'm glad 'cuz when J.J. fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies, had poison airbrushed on they asses

Dudes, had on Nike suits, and the pumas with
The fat laces, 'cuz it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin' all I had to do now, was finish homework

It's true, you don't realize really what you got till it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song
But sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Niggerole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old and guess you could say I'm holdin'
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbin'
You steady bobbin your head and I'm paid, so I got it made

But, didn't always have clout, used to live in south central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first

So Ahmad and the Jones is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but sometimes I still sit and reminence
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
