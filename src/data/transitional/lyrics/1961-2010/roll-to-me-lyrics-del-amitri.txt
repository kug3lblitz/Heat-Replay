Look around your world pretty Baby
Is it everythin' you hoped it'd be?
The wrong guy, the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me
Roll to me

Look into your heart pretty baby
Is it achin' with some nameless need?
Is there somethin' wrong
And you can't put your finger on it?
Right then, roll to me

And I don't think
I have ever seen a soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
(Ooh)
Guess who will be there?
(Aaa)

So don't try to deny it pretty Baby
You've been down so long, you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop rainin'
It's the right time to roll to me
Roll to me
Roll to me

And I don't think
I have ever seen a soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
(Ooh)
Guess who will be there?
(Aaa)

So look around your world pretty Baby
Is it everything you hoped it'd be
The wrong guy, the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me
Ooh
