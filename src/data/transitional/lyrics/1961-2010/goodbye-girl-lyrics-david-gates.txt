All your life you've waited
For love to come and stay
And now that I have found you
You must not slip away

I know it's hard believing
The words you've heard before
But darlin', you must trust them
Just once more

'Cause, baby, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye doesn't mean
We'll never be together again

If you wake up and I'm not there
I won't be long away
'Cause the things you do my goodbye girl
Will bring me back to you

I know you've been taken
Afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me
Instead of givin' in

But I can wait forever
For helpin' you to see
That I was meant for you
And you for me

So remember, goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you, goodbye doesn't mean
We'll never be together again

Though we may be so far apart
You still would have my heart
So forget your past my goodbye girl
'Cause now you're home at last
