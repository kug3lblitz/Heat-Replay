I ain't never been with a woman long enough
For my boots to get old
We've been together so long now
They both need resoled

If I ever settle down
You'd be my kind
And it's a good time for me
To head on down the line

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm the kinda man who likes to get away
Likes to start dreamin' about tomorrow today
Never said that I loved you
Even though it's so

Where's that duffle bag of mine
It's time to go

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

I'm gonna be leavin' at the break of dawn
Wish you could come
But I don't need no woman taggin' along
Always something greener

On the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder
And I guess I always will

Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong
