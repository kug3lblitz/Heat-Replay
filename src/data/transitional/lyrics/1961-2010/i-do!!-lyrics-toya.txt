He was a six foot stallion said a storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket with that rock in his ear
He made my heart stop palpitating every time he came near

He has a spankin' new range for that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin', he was plaided, and his head was cornrows
He has his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bow
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go

I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control

'Cause I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control
'Cause I do

Me and my crew started groovin', made our way to the floor
I start to activate my pad and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, roll my tounge 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance wit me I felt fingertips

On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin' hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this guy my man that I can tell you, fa show

I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control

'Cause I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control
'Cause I do

Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my ass as I dip and roll
Watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin' all the papis want me but all I want is you

I do
Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my ass as I dip and roll
Watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin all the papi's want me but all I want is you

I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control

'Cause I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control

'Cause I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control

'Cause I do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
With an iced out playah ballin' out of control
'Cause I do
