Dear darlin' surprised to hear from me?
Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily
Just to let you know, I'm gonna be home soon
I'm kinda awkward and afraid, time has changed your point of view

How you gonna see me now,please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down in oh so many ways?
How you gonna see me now, since we've been on our own?
Are you gonna love the man, when the man gets home?

Listen darlin' now I'm heading for the west
I straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess
Yes I'm worried honey yes that's natural though
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign, like a hobo in the snow

How you gonna see me now, please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down in oh so many ways?
How you gonna see me now, since we've been on our own?
Are you gonna love the man, when the man gets home?

And just like the first time, we're just strangers again
I might have grown out of style in the place I've been
And just like the first time I'll be shakin' inside
When I walk in the door there'll be no place to hide

How you gonna see me now, please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down in oh so many ways?
