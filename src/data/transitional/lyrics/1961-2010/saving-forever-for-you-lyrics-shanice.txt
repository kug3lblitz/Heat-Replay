I've never been so sure about anything before
But this loving feeling, gonna be a feeling I feel forever more
Looking in your eyes, tomorrow's all I see
As long as there's forever baby, I will always be

Saving forever for you, ooh, baby
You are the only one, I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, ooh, baby
Wanna always stay together, so I'll be saving forever for you

You'll be my world as long as there's a world turning around
And you'll be my heaven, baby till the heavens all come falling down
Look inside my heart, love is all you'll see
I'll loving you forever baby, leave it just to me

Saving forever for you, ooh, baby
You are the only one, I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, ooh, baby
Wanna always stay together so I'll be saving forever, for you

Forever I'll be loving you as long as time passes by
I'll be there besides you, all through it all, I'll be standing by you
Looking in your eyes tomorrow's all I see
Long as there's forever, baby I will always be, needing you here with me

Saving forever for you, ooh, baby
You are the only one, I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, ooh, baby
Wanna always stay together so I'll be saving forever
Saving forever, for you

Saving forever for you, ooh, baby
You are the only one, I'll ever give forever to
Love for a lifetime won't do, ooh, baby
Wanna always stay together so I'll be saving forever
Saving forever, for you

Saving forever for you, ooh, baby
You are the only one, I'll ever give forever to
