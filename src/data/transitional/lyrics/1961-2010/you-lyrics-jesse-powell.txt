I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change
In my life starting here today

I surrender all my love, I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would

And baby it's you
The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night

Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you, baby
I just wanna be yours, from this day forth

Next year lets call this day our anniversary
The day I put my heart in your hands
And said that it was yours to keep

From this moment on say
That you'll always be mine
'Cause girl when I'm alone with you
There's only one thing that's on my mind

And baby it's you
The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night

Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you, baby
Just wanna be yours, from this day forth

I just wanna be yours, from this day forth
The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night

Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you, baby
Just wanna be yours, from this day forth

The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night

Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you, baby
Just wanna be yours, from this day forth

The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night

Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you, baby
Just wanna be yours, from this day forth
