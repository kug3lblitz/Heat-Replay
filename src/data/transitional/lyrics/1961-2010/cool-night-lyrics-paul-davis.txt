I sometimes wonder why
All the flowers had to die, I dream about you
And now summer's come and gone
And the nights they seem so long

Come on over tonight
Come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you
By the firelight, if it don't feel right
You can go

Oh, oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories
Of a good life
When this love was not so old

Oh, oh, I won't talk about the past
How love's supposed to last forever
And you don't have to take a stand
Lay out any plans

Come on over tonight
Come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you
By the firelight, if it don't feel right
You can go

Oh, oh, when the cool night
Brings back memories
Of a good life
When this love was not so old

Come on over tonight
Come on over

It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you
By the firelight, if it don't feel right
You can go

On a cool night, let me hold you
On a cool night, just let me hold you
By the firelight, if it don't feel right
You can go

On a cool night, let me hold you
On a cool night, just let me hold you
By the firelight, if it don't feel right
You can go

On a cool night, let me hold you
On a cool night, just let me hold you
By the firelight, if it don't feel right
You can go
