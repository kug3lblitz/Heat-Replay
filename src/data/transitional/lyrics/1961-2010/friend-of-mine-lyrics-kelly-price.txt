She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

I feel so lost, don't know why this has happened to me
My closest friend, I never would have thought it could be
You were someone, someone I really thought I could trust
But my man you laid and I'm betrayed

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

Thicker than blood, wherever there was me, there was you
My all was your all but that wasn't enough for you
You had to see and tried to walk a mile in my shoes
In my head, in my bed, betrayed by my best friend

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why?

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused

She was a friend of mine, she left with my man
She lied, cheated, took all I had
She was a friend of mine, she used what she knew
She lied, cheated and left me confused
