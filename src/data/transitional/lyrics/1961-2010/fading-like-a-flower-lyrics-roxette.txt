In a time
Where the sun descends alone
I ran a long, long way from home
To find a heart that's made of stone

I will try
I just need a little time
To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes

Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Tell me why
When I scream, there's no reply
When I reach out, there's nothing to find
When I sleep, I break down and cry

But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Fading like a rose
Fading like a rose
Beaten by the storm

Getting washed by the rain
It's such a cold, cold town
Ooh, it's such a cold town

Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a

Everytime I see you
Oh, I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower

Everytime you leave the room
I feel I'm fading like a flower
Everytime I see you

Fading like a rose
Everytime you leave the room
Everytime I see you
