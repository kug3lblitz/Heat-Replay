I got real bored on a Friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW
I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for
I was lookin' for some company
That's right

Jerk out, jerkin' everything in sight

Jerk out, I got the cash, I got the ride, oh, Lord
Got to make some love tonight
And you know I got the look

I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar
She looked kinda all alone
So I slid on over and I asked her name
The Stella was bad to the bone

I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek
The only kind of rap it takes
She knew I was bad when I jerked her to my ride
She said, "How much money you make?"
Let's just say it'll be more money
Than you'll ever see in your lifetime

I took her to my crib and I laid her down
Her body felt kinda right
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell
I figured that was what she liked

I said, "Baby, don't get too comfortable
'Cuz I really like to sleep alone
Leave your number on the table by my data bank
I love you, but you got to go"
"What?"

Jerk out, "You ain't got to go home
But you got to get the hell outta here"
Jerkin' everything in sight, I'm talkin' about the
Jerk out, got to make some love tonight, all night
