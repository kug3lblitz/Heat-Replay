Look in the mirror girl
By now you should know
You're living in a fantasy
And you can't let go

He never really loved you from the start
The only thing he ever gave you was a broken heart
Don't be afraid to lose
What was never meant to be

After the rain washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
You live again

I know the emptiness
You feel inside
You're thinking if you break away
You'll never survive

I'm waiting as my heart beats just for you
Come on and take my hand and I'll pull you through
But things will never change
Until you want them to

After the rain washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
You live again

After the rain
You'll see the sun appear to light the way
Only after the rain
Can you hope to find true love again

He never really loved you from the start
The only thing he ever gave you was a broken heart
Come on and take my hand I'll pull you through
You know the time has come for you to face the truth

After the rain washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
You live again

After the rain
You'll see the sun appear to light the way
Only after the rain
Can you hope to find true love again

After the rain
After the rain
You live again

After the rain washes away the tears
And all the pain
Only after the rain
You live again
