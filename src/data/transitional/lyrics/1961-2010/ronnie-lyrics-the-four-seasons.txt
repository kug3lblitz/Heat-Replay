I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
So very warm and tender the way you loved me
Hey girl can't you remember and want more of me
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie how can you go
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I am regretting but can't stop forgetting because
You were my first love
You said now you don't need me because I cheated

Why didn't you believe me when I repeated
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll never know
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love

I walk alone
I cry at home
Night after night
(Night after night)
Day after day
Oh,
I never cheated

Oh
I still repeated
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll never know
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because
You were my first love
