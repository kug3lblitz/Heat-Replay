Yo see, it's rare that you find people like us
'Cause ya'll the other look out there doin' what I'm doin'
Or tryin' to do what I'm doin' but you can't
'Cause I do what I do my way
What about you? Huh, huh? come on

I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, ooh, ooh
Why's he so fly

She beeps me
Whenever she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want too
Do whatever you want but she still gon' give it up
She likes it

My way, my way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say goes and I'm in control

Don't check me, check me
It was your girl who let me, let me
Take it this far then, ooh wee, ooh we
She had to have every chance that she could get
But you think you a baller
And I ain't gon' call her
Clip that, you can get mad if you want to
Say whatever you want but she still gon' give it up
'Cause she likes it

My way, ooh my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say goes and I'm in control

I'm standing here
Where you ought to be
Got you mad at me 'cause I got your lady
You ain't got to worry, I ain't trying to romance
All I wanna do is make her dance with me

My way, oh my way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say goes and I'm in control

My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My way, my way
And what I say goes and I'm in control

My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say goes and I'm in control
