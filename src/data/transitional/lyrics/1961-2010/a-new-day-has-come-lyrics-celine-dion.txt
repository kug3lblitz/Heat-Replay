A new day, oh oh
A new day, oh oh

I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and dont shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew Id make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, its almost blinding me
I cant believe
If Ive been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come, oh

Where it was dark now theres light
Where there was pain now theres joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, its almost blinding me
I cant believe
If Ive been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun

A new day has

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come, oh

Hush, now
Well I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of the boy
I cant believe
If Ive been touched by an angel with love
I cant believe
If Ive been touched by an angel with love

Hush, now
(Ahh, ahh)
A new day
(Ahh, ahh)
Hush, now
(Ahh, ahh)
A new day
