Hey girl, what ya doin' down there?
Dancin' alone every night
While I live right above you

I can hear your music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me
You don't even know me, I love you

Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Twice on the pipe
If the answer is no

Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Oh, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show

If you look out your window tonight
Pull in the string with the note
That's attached to my heart

Read how many times I saw you
How in my silence I adored you
And only in my dreams did
That wall between us come apart

Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Mmm, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no

Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Whoa, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show

Oh, I can hear the music playin'
I can feel your body swayin'
One floor below me
You don't even know me, I love you

Oh, my darling, knock three times
On the ceiling if you want me
Oh, twice on the pipe
If the answer is no
(I love you, I love you, I love you)

Oh, my sweetness
Means you'll meet me in the hallway
Mmm, twice on the pipe
Means you ain't gonna show
