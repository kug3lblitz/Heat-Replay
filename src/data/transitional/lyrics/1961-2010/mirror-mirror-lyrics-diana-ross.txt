Mirror, mirror on the wall
You said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall
Mirror, mirror on the wall

You, you turned my life into a paperback novel
Words that come to life inside your little melodrama
Chapter one, when I was young I came to you with my problems
Chapter two, you promised me love and anything that I desired

Tell me mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said you had the answer to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall

You have nailed my heart upon the wall for your pleasures
You have cast a spell that cannot ever be broken
And now my eyes grow tired, I watch my picture getting older
But I remain the same, trapped in this mirror forever

Tell me mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall

I talk to you each night and I follow your advise
You've been wrong
What's the price I have to pay
For this fairy tale thing called love?
Let me go

Tell me mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said you had the answer to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall

Mirror, mirror

Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall
I thought you said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror on the wall

Tell me mirror
Tell me mirror
