{Come on, join the joy ride everybody
Get your tickets here
Step right this way}

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride

I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all

She has a train goin' downtown
She's got a club on the moon
But she's tellin' all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
She's the heart of the fun fair
She's got me whistlin' her private tune

And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you"
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride

She's a flower, I can paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run
Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, oh no

'Cos it all begins again when it ends
(Yeah)
And we're all magic friends
(Magic friends, magic friends)

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you"
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you"
C'mon join the joyride, be a joyride girl
Aow

I'll take you on a sky ride
A feelin' like you're spellbound
Sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby

She says, "Hello, you fool, I love you"
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride

Hello, hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon, c'mon join the joyride, be a joyride girl
