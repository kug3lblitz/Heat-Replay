I know you don't know what I'm going through
Standing here looking at you

Well, let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad, it makes me hurt so bad to see you again

Like needles and pins, people say, "You've been making out, okay
He's in love, don't stand in his way"

Well, let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad, it's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away

Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before, please love me again
I can't let you go back to her, please don't go, please don't go
Please don't go, please don't go

Hurt so bad, come back, it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad, I'm begging you, please

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, come back, it hurts so bad
Come back, it hurts so bad, I'm begging you please, oh, no, no
