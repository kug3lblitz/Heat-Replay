standing across the room
i saw you smile
said i want to talk to you-oo-oo
for a little while
but before i make my move
my emotions start running wild
my tongue gets tied
and that's no lie
looking in your eyes
looking in your big brown eyes
ooh yeah
and i've got this to say to you
hey!

girl i want to make you sweat
sweat till you can't sweat no more
and if you cry out
i'm gonna push it some, more, more
girl i want to make you sweat
sweat till you can't sweat no more
and if you cry out
i'm gonna push it
push it, push it some more

so i said to myself
does she love me or not?
but the dreads done know
that love is his to get
with a little bit of this
and a little bit of that
my lyric goes on the attack
my tongue gets tied
and that's no lie
looking in you eyes
looking in your big brown eyes
