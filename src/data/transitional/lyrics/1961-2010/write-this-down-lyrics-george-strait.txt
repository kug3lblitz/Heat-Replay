I never saw the end in sight
Fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright
But I was running out of time

'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read 'em everyday
Keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of this page
I'll swear under oath
'Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know

So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your 'frigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

An' take my words and read 'em everyday
Keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

You can find a chisel
I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words
Long after we're gone

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read 'em everyday
Keep 'em close by, don't you let 'em fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

Oh I love you and I dont want you to go
Baby, write this down
