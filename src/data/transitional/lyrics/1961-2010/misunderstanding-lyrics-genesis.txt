There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I waited in the rain for hours, you were late

Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could'nt called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that may be we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
Oh but seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
I was waiting in the rain for hours, you were late

Since then I've been runnin' around tryin' to find you
I went to the places that we always go
I rang your house but got no answer
Jumped in my car, I went round there
Still don't believe it, he was just leavin'

There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
There must be some misunderstanding
There must be some kind of mistake
(There must be, there must be, ohh)
Misunderstanding
(There must be, there must be, ohh)
Misunderstanding
(There must be, there must be, ohh)
Misunderstanding
(There must be, there must be, ohh)
Misunderstanding
