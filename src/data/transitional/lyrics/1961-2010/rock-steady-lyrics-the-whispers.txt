I looked at you, you stole my heart
You were all that I anticipated
I wanted you, every part
But I knew love would be complicated

I began to touch but you wouldn't let it
It never seemed to be the right time
I started to give up, down to the limit
And then you changed your mind, oh

And we begin to rock steady, steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady, rockin' till the break of dawn
Rock steady, steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady, rockin' till the break of dawn

You looked at me to my surprise
You were through anticipating
I should have known, it was in your eyes
That you were gettin' tired of waiting

You wanted me so much but I didn't get it
How could a fellow be so blind?
I started to give up but love wouldn't let it
Then you walked into my life

And we begin to rock steady, steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady, rockin' till the break of dawn
Rock steady, steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady, rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock steady, baby, rock steady, baby
Ooh, rock, rock steady, baby, rock steady, baby
Rock, ooh, rock, rock

You wanted me so much, I didn't get it
How could a fellow be so blind?
I started to give up but love wouldn't let it
And you walked into my life, oh

And we begin to rock steady, steady rockin' all night long
And we begin to rock steady, rockin' till the break of dawn
Rock steady, steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady, rockin' till the break of dawn

Rock steady, steady rockin' all night long
Rock steady, rockin' till the break of dawn
Everybody start rockin'
