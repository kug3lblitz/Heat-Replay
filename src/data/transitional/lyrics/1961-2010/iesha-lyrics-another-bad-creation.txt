Iesha, Iesha so glad to meetcha
See you in the schoolyard strollin' wit' your techa
The lil' skirt you played was really fly
She turned around and she winked her eye

So I stepped to her like I knew her
The Biv is cool but Romell is cooler
The bell rang 'cuz I started to talk
Yet the class is not there no more

(Yo Red, where'd you meet her?)
At the playground, ya know, that's where I saw this cutie
This girl was swingin' and she looked so fly
On the monkey bars, we climbed up to the top and
She touched my hand that's when I fell in love

Iesha, you are the girl that I neva had
And I want to get to know you bettah
Iesha, you know I want you so bad
And there's nothing anyone can do
To keep me away from you

Yo Dallas man these five young boys
Out of Atlanta GA are a real adventure
They kinda like remind me of me and my boys
New Edition, know what I'm sayin'

So all you people out there ridin' in your cars
Listenin' to the radio station
Or coolin' back in the living room watchin' this here video
Ay yo peep the 2nd verse

We played Nintendo, this was her very first date
I didn't wanna make it seem to fly, we ate cereal
She couldn't stay out at late
Her mother told her to be home at nine

Iesha, you are the girl that I neva had
And I want to get to know you bettah
Iesha, you know I want you so bad
And there's nothing anyone can do
To keep me away from you

Chris, Mark, Red, Da, Ro
Chris, Mark, Red, Da, Ro

Yo Ro you might sound to sure so wutcha gonna do?
I dunno Da, I only got one more rap
And I'm gonna see what happens

Threw down my books went up to the door
Pressed the bell what was in store?
Iesha came out with a smile
(Oh no)

She ain't worth the while
So I passed her a lolli pop and a letter
Told her so let's keep this a secret
No remember Iesha, only you can keep this, peace
