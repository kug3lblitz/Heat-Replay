Kissing you is not what I had planned
And now I'm not so sure just where I stand
I wasn't looking for true love
But now you're looking at me
You're the only one I can think of
You're the only one I see

All I need is just a little more time
To be sure of what I feel is it all in my mind
'Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

Yes it's true we've all been hurt before
But it doesn't seem to matter anymore
It may be a chance we're taking
But it always comes to this
If this isn't love we're makin'
Then I don't know what it is

All I need is just a little more time
To be sure of what I feel is it all in my mind
'Cause it seems so hard to believe

All I need is just a little more time
To be sure of what I feel is it all in my mind
'Cause it seems so hard to believe
That you're all I need

No stars are out tonight but we're shining our own light
And it's never felt so right 'cause girl the way I'm feeling
It's easy to believe that you're all I need
Ahh you're all I need, ooh ahh
