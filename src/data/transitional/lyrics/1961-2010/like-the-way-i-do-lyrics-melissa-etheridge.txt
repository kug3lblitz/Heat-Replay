Is it so hard to satisfy your senses
You found out to love me
You have to climb some fences
Scratching and crawling along the floor to touch you

And just when it feels right
You say you found someone to hold you
Does she like I do?

Baby, tell me does she love you
Like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you
Attract and captivate you?

Tell me does she miss you
Existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do?

Tell me does she want you
Infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you
Electrify and rock you?

Does she inject you
Seduce you and affect you?
Like the way I do, like the way I do

Can I survive all
The implications even if I tried?
Could you be less than an addiction?

Don't you think I know there's so many others
Who would beg, steal and lie, fight, kill and die
Just to hold you, hold you like I do

Baby, tell me does she love you
Like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you
Attract and captivate you?

Tell me does she miss you
Existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do?

Tell me does she want you
Infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you
Electrify and rock you?

Does she inject you
Seduce you and affect you
Like the way I do?

Nobody loves you
Like the way I do
Nobody wants you
Like the way I do

Nobody needs you
Like the way I do
Nobody aches, nobody aches
Just to hold you
Like the way I do

No, no, no

Tell me does she love you
Like the way I love you?
Does she stimulate you
Attract and captivate you?

Baby, baby, tell me does she miss you
Existing just to kiss you
Like the way I do?

Now, tell me does she want you
Infatuate and haunt you?
Does she know just how to shock you
Electrify and rock you?

Does she inject you
Seduce you and affect you, baby
Like the way I do?
No, like the way I do
