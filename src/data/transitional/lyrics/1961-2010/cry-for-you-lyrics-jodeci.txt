Without you baby
I feel worthless
I'm livin on the edge

It's been an hour
Since you've been gone
And that's too long
So come back home

I can't live without you
So I'll cry for you
Do anything that I can
To feel that touch from your hand
Sorry that I want you
Lady what do I do

You know you're everything I do
Ooh yeah, do what you want me to
I would do anything
Get on my knees for you

Ooh, baby
What else is there to do
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll cry

Lady I, will cry for you tonight
Tonight, yeah
Lady I, will cry for you tonight
(Help me out, help me out, yeah)
Tonight

You spoil me girl, like a child
When you're not here I can't even smile
I can't think without you
My mind is always with you

It's amazing what you do
To keep me falling in love with you
Girl you all that I know
Where else can I go

I say, you know you're everything i do
Ooh wee, do what you want me to
Anything you need from me baby
Get on my knees for you

Ohh, ooh, ohh
What else is there to do
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll cry

Lady I, will cry for you tonight
Tonight
Lady I, will cry for you tonight
(Help me out baby, help me out baby, yes)
Tonight
(I don't know what else to say)
(I don't know what else to say)
K-ci help me sing it

Lady I, will cry for you tonight
(Jojo I'm right here yes I am)
(I will cry for you lady)
Tonight
(Sometimes my pillow gets so wet with tears)
(I don't have no one to call my own)
I want you back baby

Lady I, will cry for you tonight
Tonight
(Ooh yeah)

Baby I'm beggin', baby I'm beggin', beggin' baby
Baby I'm beggin', baby I'm beggin', beggin' baby
Baby I'm beggin', baby I'm beggin', beggin' baby
