Constantly, constantly, constantly
I think about you all the time
Constantly you're on my mind

At night I try to close my eyes
But I, I can't get much sleep
You're always on my mind
You look so fine, I often pretend
That your my girl or at least my friend

If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know, I long to be with you?
Every single way of every single day
I start driftin' away and I think of you

(Constantly)
I've got you on my mind constantly
(Constantly)
And not just all the time I think about you
(Constantly)
If you only knew, I'm crazy for you
(I think about you all the time)
(Constantly you're on my mind)

I practice my words and I build up the nerve
But uh words disappear whenever you are near
I catch your eye time after time
Is love in the air or is it all in my mind?

And you, you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know, I long to be with you?
In each and every way and every single day
I start driftin' away and I think of you

(Constantly)
You're always on my mind I think about
(Constantly)
And not just all the time I think about you, baby
(Constantly)
Oh, if you only knew, I'm crazy for you
(I think about you all the time)
(Constantly you're on my mind)

Yeah, yeah, baby
Oh yeah, ooh, yeah yeah
I think about you, baby
You're always on my mind

Constantly, constantly, constantly
I think about you all the time
Constantly you're on my mind

Constantly, constantly, constantly
I think about you all the time
