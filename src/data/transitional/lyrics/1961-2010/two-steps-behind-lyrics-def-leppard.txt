Walk away if you want to
It's okay, if you need to
You can run but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creepin' up beside you

There's a magic runnin' through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around, I'll be two steps behind

Take the time to think about it
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire that's burnin' up inside me

There's a magic runnin' through your soul
But you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around, I'll be two steps behind

There's a magic runnin' through your soul
But you, you can't have it all

(Whatever you do)
I'll be two steps behind you
(Wherever you go)
And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around, I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, baby
Two steps behind
Oh, sugar
Two steps behind
