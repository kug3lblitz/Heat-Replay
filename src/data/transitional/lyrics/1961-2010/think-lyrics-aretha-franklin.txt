You better think
(Think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Yeah, think
(Think, think)
Let your mind go let yourself be free

Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't a been too much more than ten
(Just a child)

I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with degrees
It don't take too much I.Q.
To see what you're doin' to me

You better think
(Think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Yeah, think
(Think, think)
Let your mind go let yourself be free

Oh freedom
(Freedom)
Say, "Some freedom"
(Freedom)
Oh freedom
Yeah freedom
(Yeah)

Oh now freedom
(Freedom)
Freedom
(Freedom)
Need you some freedom
Oh freedom, oh now
(Yeah)
Hey, think about it
You, think about it

There ain't nothin' you could ask
I could answer you with, I won't
(I won't)
But I was gonna change my mind if
You keep doin' things I don't
(Don't)

You better think
(Think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Yeah, think
(Think, think)
Let your mind go let yourself be free

People walkin' around everyday
Playin' games and takin' scores
Tryin' to make other people lose their minds
Well be careful you don't lose yours

Oh think
(Think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Think
(Think)
Let your mind go let yourself be free

You need me and I need you
Without each other, ain't nothin' neither can do, oh

Oh yeah, think about it baby
(Whatcha tryin' to do me, think?)
Let it go baby, think about it right now
Yeah right now
(To the bone for deepness)
Right now
(To the bone for deepness)
Yeah right now
(To the bone for deepness)
I need to change your mind
(Think about it)
Baby baby baby
