Now I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
Crimson and clover

Well if she come walkin' over
Now I been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover, over and over

Yeah, my mind's such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything, what a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover, over and over

Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
