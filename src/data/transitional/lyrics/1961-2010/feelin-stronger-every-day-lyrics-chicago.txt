I do believe in you
And I know you believe in me
Oh yeah, oh yeah

But now we've realized
Love's not all that it's supposed to be
Oh yeah, oh yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
I know we really tried together we had love inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah

So now the time has come
For both of us to live on the run
Oh yeah, oh yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah

After what you've meant to me
Ooo baby now
I can make it easily
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know that we both agree
Best thing that happened to you
The worst thing that happened to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day
