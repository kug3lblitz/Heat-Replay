Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in
I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memorys that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for for so long
And I know somewhere

If I keep lookin', that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love
A love I know I'll have the girl that I want
She'll be mine, she'll be fly and it'll last

I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that love

She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love, oh love

(Love, oh love)
Love is a feeling that the Hammer definitely needs, oh yeah
(Love is a feeling that I need, oh yeah)
(Please be mine)
Baby be mine
(I need your love to make it)

I need your love to make it
(So be mine)
So why don't you be mine
(Baby, be mine)
Oh yes, be mine

The search is going on from coast to coast
A women for the man, who's propping the most
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)

My heart is beating strong
This love cannot be wrong
I need her and I want her, so come on to my home
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I'm a keep looking

At the movies, in my car, on my stero
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Yo Veo, tell me what's up

At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, 'cause I'm in love
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad

(Love, oh love)
Love is a feeling that I know I need, oh yeah
(Love is a feeling that I need, oh yeah)
(Please be mine)
Be mine, baby
(I need your love to make it)

I need your love to make it
(So be mine)
Why don't you be mine
(Baby, be mine)
Where could she be?

At the store around the corner or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Hammer, you know I'm looking

Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Lavertte or my homey Rob Base
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo Veo, on the phone

Ted, Dre or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I got a picture in my mind

The thought is so clear of the love I need here
Like Houdini be magic and why don't you appear
(Have you seen her?)
Oh baby, why don't you appear
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
I can see yo,' face

I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door and you know I'll let you in
(Have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Tell me have you seen her?)
Oh, my sweet love

Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?
The girl is hard to see like an unseen V.J.
(Have you seen her?
(Tell me have you seen her?)
(Have you seen her?)
