Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember
When we met that summer?

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

Hip Hop Marmalade spic and span
Met you one summer and it all began
Your the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird Jersey 33

When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy

Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer then went back home
Macauly Culkin wasn't Home Alone

Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J Fox was Alex P Keaton
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

Cheery Pez, Cold Crush, rock star Boogie
Used to hate school so I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the B-boy style
Known to act wild and make girls smile

Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you because you rock my world
You come from Georgia where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade and speak real slow

You love hip hop and rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when you were four years old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I feel much better, baby, when you're near

You love fun dip and cherry coke
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

In the summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike

Bugaloo shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back there, oh, so quick
Let you off the hook like my man Mr. Lipit
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it

Like the color purple, macaroni and cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
Call you up but what's the use
I like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose

Came in the door said it before
I think I'm over you but I'm really not sure
When I met you I said my name was Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie and Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer

'Cause summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worth while and some are so so
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worth while and some are so so

Summertime girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer, since that summer
