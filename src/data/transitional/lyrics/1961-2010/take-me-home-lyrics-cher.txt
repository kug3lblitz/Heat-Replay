Take me home
Take me home
Want to feel you close to me
Take me home
Take me home
With you is where I wanna be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just makin' love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

Take me home
(Take me home)
Take me home
(Take me home)
Oh can't you see I want you near
(Can't you see I want you near)
Take me home
(Take me home)
Take me home
(Take me home)
Ooh baby, let's get out of here

I'd follow you anywhere
Your place or mine
Just a one night only
Would be so fine

I'm in Heaven
(Heaven)
Seems like Heaven
(Heaven)
So much in Heaven
(Heaven)
Take me home
Take me home

One night with you
Lyin' here next to me
It's the right thing to do
It would be ecstasy

I'm in Heaven
(Heaven)
Seems like Heaven
(Heaven)
So much in Heaven
(Heaven)

Take me home
(Take me home)
Take me home
(Take me home)
Ooh, I wanna feel you close to me
(I wanna feel you close)
Take me home
(Take me home)
Take me home
(Take me home)
With you is where I wanna be

Wrapped in your arms tonight
Just makin' love
Music and candlelight
Stars up above

I'm in Heaven
(Heaven)
Seems like Heaven
(Heaven)
(Take me)
(Take me home, I need you)

Come on and take me
Ooh baby, baby take me home
(Take me)
(Take me home I need you)
You'll be lyin' next to me
Baby it'd be ecstasy
(Take me)
(Take me home, home with you)
Oh, can't you see I want you near
Baby, baby let's get out of here
(Take me)
