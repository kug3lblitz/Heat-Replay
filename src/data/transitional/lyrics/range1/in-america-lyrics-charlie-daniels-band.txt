We'll the eagle's been flying slow and the flag's been flying low
And a lot of people's saying that America's fixing to fall
But speaking just for me and some people from Tennessee
We got a thing or two to tell you all

This lady may have stumbled but she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that they can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back on the path of the righteousness
And then God bless America again

And you never did think that it ever would happen again
In America, did you?
You never did think that we'd ever get together again
Well we damn sure fooled you
We're walking real proud and we're talking real loud again
In America, you never did think that it ever would happen again

From the sound up in Long Island out to San Francisco Bay
And every thing that's in between them is our home
And we may have done a little bit of fighting amongst ourselves
But you outside people best leave us alone

'Cause we'll all stick together and you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks
You just go and lay your head on a Pittsburgh Stealer fan
And I think you're gonna finally understand

And you never did think that it ever would happen again
In America, did you?
You never did think that we'd ever get together again
Well we damn sure fooled you
We're walking real proud and we're talking real loud again
In America you never did think that it ever would happen again

And you never did think that it ever would happen again
In America, did you?
You never did think that we'd ever get together again
Well we damn sure fooled you
We're walking real proud and we're talking real loud again
In America, you never did think that it ever would happen again
