Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need, somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things, you need to borrow
For, no one can fill those of your needs
That you don't let show

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need, somebody to lean on

Just call on me brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For, said it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need, somebody to lean on

If there is a low, you have to bear
That you can't carry
I'll ride up the road, I'll share your load
If you just call me

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For, said it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need, somebody to lean onJust call on me
(Ah, when you need a friend)
Call on me
(Oh, baby now)

Call on me
(Ah, when you need a friend)
Call me
(Oh, baby now)

Call on me
(Ah, when you need a friend)
Call on me
(Oh, baby now)

Call on me
Lean on me
