I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again, I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause this love is everlasting

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly, you're in love

Girl, you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before, now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly, you're in love

Each day I pray
This love affair would last forever

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, suddenly, you're in love

There's beauty up above
Things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly, you're in love
