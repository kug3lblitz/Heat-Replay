What's happenin homie dis the one Plies man hey pain tell 'em
Bout your shawty and I tell them bout mine

Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl
I'ma call you my shawty
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't supposed to do
'Cause you my shawty
Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ring tone shawty
Sing it to me girl

Soon as I seen her, shit told her I'd pay for it
Lil mama the baddest thing `round here and she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her this supposed to be yours
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it
First time I [called ?] her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil bustie baby cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whenever I wanna get off she know how to get me right

Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl
I'ma call you my shawty
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't supposed to do
'Cause you my shawty
Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ring tone shawty
Sing it to me girl

Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whooooa whoa whoa
Whoa w-w-whoa shawtyyyyy
Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whooooa whoa whoa
Whoa w-w-whoa shawtyyyyy

I love to show her off, cause all the dope boys want her
Know why they wanna beat [badly ?], look at all that ass on her
Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bo-legged and bend the [corner ?]
She proud to be fuckin me, cause I'm stuntin on `em
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga don't`uh
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin her off, cause she aint with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat [her under ?]
[?] snatchin [?], I'm tellin ya, I promise
I exposed her to real, and now she hate lame
Member she used to run from me, now she like pain
She call me sometimes just to ask is it her thing
Ever since I ran up in shawty she ain't been the same

Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl
I'ma call you my shawty
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't supposed to do
'Cause you my shawty
Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ring tone shawty
Sing it to me girl

Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whooooa whoa whoa
Whoa w-w-whoa shawtyyyyy
Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whooooa whoa whoa
Whoa w-w-whoa shawtyyyyy
