He was a famous trumpet man from out Chicago way
He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft, but then his number came up
And he was gone with the draft, he's in the army now a blowin' reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he couldn't jam
The captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the cap' went out and drafted the band
And now the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

A root, a toot, a toodlie-a-da-toot, he blows it eight to the bar
In boogie rhythm, he can't blow a note unless a bass
And guitar is playin' with him
He makes the company jump when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
He was some boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

When he played his boogie woogie bugle, he was busy as a bzzzz bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight to the bar
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
Andata toodliata-toodliata toot toot, he blows it eight to the bar
He can't blow a note if a bass and guitar isn't with him
And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands and stamp their feet
'Cause they know how he plays when someone gives him a beat
Woh, woh, he wakes 'em up when he plays reveille
The boogie woogie bugle boy of company B

A root, a toot, a toodli-a-da to toot toot toot, he's blowin' eight to the bar
Can't blow a note if a bass and guitar isn't, woh, with him
And the company jumps when he plays reveille
He's the boogie woogie bugle boy of company B
