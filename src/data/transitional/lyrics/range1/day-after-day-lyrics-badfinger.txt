I remember finding out about you
Everyday my mind is all around you

Looking out of my lonely room
Day after day
Bring it home maybe make it soon
I give my love to you

I remember holding you while you sleep
Everyday I feel the tears that you weep

Looking out of my lonely gloom
Day after day
Bring it home maybe make it soon
I give my love to you

Looking out of my lonely gloom
Day after day
Bring it home maybe make it soon
I give my love to you

I remember finding out about you
Everyday my mind is all around you

Looking out of my lonely gloom
Day after day
Bring it home maybe make it soon
I give my love to you
