I never meant to lie to you
But I needed me an easy way out
I couldn't face the truth with you
Because I didn't want to lose my clout
I always have been good to you
Girl, I promise you that nothing has changed
Momentary insanity
Must be the reason why I did you that way, babe
So now I'm telling everybody
That I, that I know I was a fool
To take a chance of losing
And I can't take losing you

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

I didn't want to lie to you
But I didn't want to let you down
It never did occur to me
Sooner or later that you would find out
You know how much I care for you
And I would never want to cause you pain
I know that there is no excuse
How could I ever treat my baby that way?
So now I'm telling everybody
That I, that I know I was a fool
But I don't give a damn about it
'Cause I wanna get back with you, and

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you baby, you baby

If you wanna go I want you to know
Girl, that I understand it but I don't recommend it
'Cause I love you more, you can't ignore
That I will die for you and even lay down my life for you
Girl girl, I wanna see you standing next to me
Girl, I apologize for each and every lie
I, I want you to be the only one for me
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No, I'm never keeping secrets
Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

So I'm never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you

Girl, I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you
