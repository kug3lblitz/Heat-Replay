I've got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing, but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around?

And I look into the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I've made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love ever lasting
Feeling no pain, when will we meet again?

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
You've made the rules and you could not see
You've made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try, or should we say goodbye?

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by

Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you

Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
When I was being what you want me to be
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by

Help me
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
