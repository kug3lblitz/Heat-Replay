Baby, please
Please, don't take your love from me
I am yours forever more
'Til eternity

Silently
Listen to the words I say
Well, I'm not talking just for play
Listen to me, please

Heaven knows
It's not the way it should be
And Heaven knows
It's not the way it could be
Don't you know?
There's no need to leave

Heaven knows
I never wanna leave you
Heaven knows
Only wanna please you
Don't you know?
Love is what I need

Down inside
Don't get caught with foolish pride
Put all the other things aside
It's only you and me

Believe in us
We were always meant to be
Me for you and you for me
Till eternity

Heaven knows
It's not the way it should be
And Heaven knows
It's not the way it could be
And don't you know?
There's no need to leave

Heaven knows
I never wanna leave you
Heaven knows
I only wanna please you
Don't you know?
Love is what I need

Heaven knows
It's not the way it should be
And Heaven knows
It's not the way it could be
Don't you know?
There's no need to leave

Heaven knows
It's not the way it should be
And Heaven knows
It's not the way it could be
And don't you know?
There's no need to leave
