Saturday in the park
I think, it was the fourth of July
Saturday in the park
I think, it was the fourth of July

People dancing, people laughing
A man selling ice cream
Singing Italian songs
"Eh Cumpari, ci vo sunari"
Can you dig it? Yes, I can
And I've been waiting such a long time
For Saturday

Another day in the park
I think, it was the fourth of July
Another day in the park
I think, it was the fourth of July

People talking, really smiling
A man playing Guitar
And singing for us all
Will you help him change the world
Can you dig it? Yes, I can
And I've been waiting such a long time
For today

Slow motion riders, fly the colors of the day
A bronze man, still can tell stories his own way
Listen children all is not lost
All is not lost, oh no, no

Funny days in the park
And every day is the fourth of July
Funny days in the park
And every day is the fourth of July

People reaching, people touching
A real celebration
Waiting for us all
If we want it, really want it
Can you dig it? Yes, I can
And I've been waiting such a long time
For the day
