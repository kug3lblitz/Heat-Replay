Check it out
See what I believe is
We was granted the power
What's that? Power what?
Ha, the power to make you dance
Like this

I heard she's got a nine to five
But comin' in after twelve
I know they're tired of her lies
Just let her go, what the deal?
And now take me for instance babe
See my love will drive her crazy

'Cause I'll be goin' boom like an eight O eight
Be makin' circles like a figure eight
You know it feels good from head to toe
Now hold on to me baby here we go
You'll be goin' boom baby, boom baby, boom
And I'll be goin' ooh baby, ooh baby ooh

I heard she's not all that to you
'Cause she can't do it like I do
So put that trophy on the shelf
Go out and find somebody else
Now take me for instance babe
See my love will drive her crazy

'Cause I'll be goin' boom like an eight O eight
Be makin' circles like a figure eight
You know it feels good from head to toe
Now hold on to me baby here we go
You'll be goin' boom baby, boom baby, boom
And I'll be goin' ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh

Boom like an eight O eight
Circles like a figure eight
Feels good from head to toe
To me baby here we go

Yo, ain't nobody can bang it like me
Stack it like me, wouldn't like me
Ask Kelly, his original plan
To get as large on the map
By makin' you clap your hands
Damn shoo bizzatch

I'm not gonna lie
I'll pump my amps to this
Cutie pie, honey bunch
If you're not busy take me to lunch
Oh, ya'll done did it now

With the luscious music, world poppin' crews
And what, eight boost and and what tellin' yous, yeah
Give me up you one in a million
Forget the mens
'Cause they ride in my pocket baby

And today I just wanna
Jiggle my ball
Bet I knock your socks off
Wit' my what? What? What?
Yeah, yeah

Boom like an eight O eight
Circles like a figure eight
Feels good from head to toe
To me baby here we go

Boom like an eight O eight
Circles like a figure eight
Feels good from head to toe
To me baby here we go

You'll be goin' boom baby, boom baby, boom
And I'll be goin' ooh baby, ooh baby ooh
You'll be goin' boom baby, boom baby, boom
And I'll be goin' ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh

Boom like an eight O eight
Circles like a figure eight
Feels good from head to toe
To me baby here we go

Boom like an eight O eight
Circles like a figure eight
Feels good from head to toe
To me baby here we go

Boom like an eight O eight
Circles like a figure eight
Feels good from head to toe
To me baby here we go
