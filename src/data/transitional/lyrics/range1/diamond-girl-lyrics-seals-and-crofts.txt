Diamond girl, you sure do shine
Glad I found you, glad you're mine

Oh my love, you're like a precious stone
Part of earth where heaven has rained on
Makes no difference where you are
Day or night time, you're like a shinin' star
How could I shine without you
When it's about you that I am?

Diamond girl, roamin' wild
Such a rare thing, radiant child

I could never find, another one like you
Part of me is deep down inside you
And you feel the whole world is turnin'
We are real, and we are burnin', hey
Diamond girl, now that I've found you
Well it's about you that I am
