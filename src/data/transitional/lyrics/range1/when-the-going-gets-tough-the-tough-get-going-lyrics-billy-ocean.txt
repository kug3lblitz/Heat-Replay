When the going gets tough
The tough get going, tough, tough
When the going gets tough, the tough get ready

I got something to tell you
I got something to say
I'm gonna put this dream in motion
Never let nothing stand in my way
When the going gets touch
The tough get going

Well I'm gonna get myself 'cross the river
That's the price I'm willing to pay
I'm gonna make you stand and deliver
And give me love in the old-fashion way

Darlin', I'll climb any mountain
Darlin', I'll do anything

Oh, can I touch you?
And do the things that lovers do
Oh, wanna hold you
I gotta get it through to you, oh

When the going gets tough
The tough get going
When the going gets rough
The tough get rough
Hey, hey, hey oh baby

I'm gonna buy me a one-way ticket
Nothin's gonna hold me back
Your love's like a slow train coming
And I feel it coming down the track

Darlin', I'll climb any mountain
Darlin', I'll do anything

Ooh, can I touch you?
And do the things that lovers do
Ooh, wanna hold you
I gotta get it through to you

'Cos when the going gets tough
The tough get going
When the going gets rough
The tough get rough

Darlin', I'll climb any mountain
Darlin', I'll swim any sea
Darlin', I'll reach for the Heaven
Darlin', with you lovin' me

Oh, can I touch you?
And do the things that lovers do
Oh, wanna hold you
I gotta get it through to you

When the going gets tough
Going get rough
When the going gets tough
Going get rough
When the going gets tough
Going get rough
