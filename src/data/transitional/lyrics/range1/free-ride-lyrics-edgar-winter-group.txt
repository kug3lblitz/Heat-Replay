The mountain is high, the valley is low
And you're confused 'bout which way to go
So I flew here to give you a hand
And lead you into the promised land

So, come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and take it by my side
Come on and take a free ride

All over the country, I'm seeing the same
Nobody's winning, at this kind of game
We gotta do better, it's time to begin
You know all the answers
Must come from within

So, come on and take a free ride (free ride)
Come on and take it by my side
Come on and take a free ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah
