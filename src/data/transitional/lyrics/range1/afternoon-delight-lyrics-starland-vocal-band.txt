Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been, when it's right it's right
Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
Then we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

Thinking of you's working up an appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together make the sparks ignite
And the thought of rubbin' you is gettin' so excited

Sky rocket's in flight, afternoon delight
Afternoon delight, afternoon delight

Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always though a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you've got some bait a waitin'
And I think I might try nibbling a little afternoon delight

Sky rocket's in flight, afternoon delight
Afternoon delight, afternoon delight

Be waiting for me, baby, when I come around
We can make a lot of lovin' 'fore the sun goes down

Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite
And the thought of lovin' you is getting so exciting

Sky rocket's in flight, afternoon delight
Afternoon delight, afternoon delight
Afternoon delight, afternoon delight
