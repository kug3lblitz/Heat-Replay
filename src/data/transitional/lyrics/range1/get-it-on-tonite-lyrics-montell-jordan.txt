When I'm looking at you I keep thinking
Why can't she be like you, so I'm scheming
I can't go on like this
Believing that her love is true, oh

Standing on the dance floor while she's trickin'
You are all I want girl, she's a chicken
We might be together, but love is missing
Girl I want you, so what can we do, oh

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Now she's looking at me, but keep talking
Oh, now she's trying to ice you, let's start walking
Over on the dance floor
It's her fault but what can she do?
Tell me baby, yeah

Girl if you're ready
(I'm ready)
We can get it on
(We can get it on)
I know where I went wrong
(She's where you went wrong)
With you is where I belong, belong

Girl if I could find the words to say
I gotta get away from a love
That kills me everyday
I'd gladly say to you

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
I've got a girl but you look good tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
My baby's stressin' me
You need to come with me
We need to go somewhere, yeah
Tonight, tonight

Girl if it's alright
Let's go somewhere and get it on tonight
You shouldn't have to be alone tonight
It's one on one tonight, tonight
