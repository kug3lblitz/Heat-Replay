She seems a million miles away
When she walks by, you dont know what to say
You gonna make a move, you better make it now
Dont be afraid, 'cause love will show you how

You take that first step
Ask her out and treat her like a lady
Second step, tell her
Shes the one youre dreaming of

Third step, take her in your arms
And never let her go
Dont you know step by step
Step by step, youll win her love

She looks too beautiful to touch
But your heart keeps talking to you now, dont give up
You think you see something in her eye
But you will never know until you try

But you gotta take that first step
Ask her out and treat her like a lady
Second step, tell her
Shes the one youre dreaming of

Third step, take her in your arms
And never let her go
Dont you know that step by step
Step by step, youll win her love

Second step, third step
Dont you know step by step
Step by step

First step, ask her out
And treat her like a lady
Second step, tell her
Shes the one youre dreaming of

Third step, take her in your arms
And never let her go
Dont you know that step by step
Step by step, youll win her love

Second step, third step
Dont you know step by step
Step by step

First step, ask her out
And treat her like a lady
Second step, tell her
Shes the one youre dreaming of

Third step, take her in your arms
And never let her go
Dont you know that step by step
Step by step, youll win her love
