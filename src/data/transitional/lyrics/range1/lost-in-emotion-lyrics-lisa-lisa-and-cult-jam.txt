Hit the beat now
Lost in emotion

Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waiting for that love that I might be getting
My dreams have yet begun, oh baby

Am I a fool 'cause I don't know
Just how you feel?
And this love for you
Oh, I can't conceal

Oh, I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool? I guess my friends think so

Qu-sera, que-sera
Baby, whatever will be?
Que-sera, que-sera
Between you and me

Just how true are the rumors I am hearing
About the crush you have on me?
Maybe I'm blind, but I just don't see it
But I wanna believe what they see

I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend
I keep showing my emotions not knowing
Just where it all stands for us

From time to time I wonder
What I am in your heart
And even though I don't live there yet
I'm afraid, it will be cold and dark

I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh, baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool? I guess my friends think so

Qu-sera, que-sera
Baby, whatever will be?
Que-sera, que-sera
Between you and me, oh no

Baby, am I a fool 'cause I don't know
Just how you feel?
This love for you
Oh, I can't conceal

Hit the beat now (lost)
In my feelings (lost)
I hit the ceiling (lost)
from the emotions
I keep revealing
I wanna be with you
But I don't know how
in my heart, babe
I can feel the beat now

Lost in emotion (my baby)
Lost in emotion (my baby)
Lost in emotion

Lost, my baby, you know that I'm lost
My baby, lost in emotion, my baby
Lost in emotion, lost in emotion, lost
