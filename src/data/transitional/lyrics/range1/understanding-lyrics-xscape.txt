What I need from you
Is understanding
How can we communicate
If you don't hear what I say

What I need from you
Is understanding
So simple as 1, 2,3
Understanding is what we need

You don't really know me
You just wanna do
What you wanna do
That's not the way it should be

No, you should listen to me boy
I try so very hard to make you understand
But the choices you make
Baby, they're all demands

I try so very hard to keep our love alive
But you don't wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies

There's no way that we can work it out
If we don't pull together
I don't mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you

What I need from you
Is understanding
How can we communicate
If you don't hear what I say

What I need from you
Is understanding
So simple as 1-2-3
Understanding is what we need

I listen to you, baby
And I know the things
You're going through
I try to understand
That's why I'm still here with you,baby

See everyday we're living
Is one thing that will always be unsure
That's why I need you baby, pleading, baby
Please let our love endure

I try so very hard to keep our love alive
But you don't wanna meet me half way
Then the understanding dies

There's no way that we can work it out
If we don't pull together
I don't mean to be demanding
But I want some understanding
I wanna be with you
