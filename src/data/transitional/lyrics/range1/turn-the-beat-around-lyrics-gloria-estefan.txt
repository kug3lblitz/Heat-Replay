Turn the beat around
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down

Blow horns you sure sound pretty
Your violins keep movin' to the nitty gritty
When you hear the scratch of the guitar scratchin'
Then you'll know that the rhythm carries all the action, oh yeah

Turn the beat around (turn it around)
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down (turn it up, turn it up, turn it upside down)
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Turn the beat around

Flute player play you're flute 'cause
I know that you want to get your thing off
But you see I've made up my mind about it
To me it is the rhythm, no doubt about it, woah, woah
'Cause when the guitar player starts playing
With the syncopated rhythm, with the scratch, scratch, scratch
Makes me want to move my body yeah, yeah, yeah
And when the drummer starts beating that beat
He nails that beat with the syncopated rhythm
With the rat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, on the drums, hey

Turn the beat around (turn it 'roud and 'round and 'round)
Love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down
Love to hear percussion
Love to hear it
Love to hear it
Love to hear it
Love to hear it
