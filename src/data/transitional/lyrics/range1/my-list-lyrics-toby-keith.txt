Under an old brass paperweight is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store, put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

Go for a walk, say a little prayer, take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove, play some catch, it's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line, look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin' that's the next thing on my list

Wouldn't change the course of fate, cuttin' the grass just had to wait
'Cause I've got more important things
Like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks I can't take to my grave
So I'll put off for tomorrow what I could get done today

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer, take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch, it's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line, look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin', that's the next thing on my list

Raise a little hell, laugh 'til it hurts put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat, it's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep, show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start livin', that's the next thing on my list
