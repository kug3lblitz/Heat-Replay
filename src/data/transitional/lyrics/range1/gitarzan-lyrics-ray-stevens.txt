He's free as the breeze, he's always at ease
He lives in the jungle and hangs by his knees
As he swings through the trees without a trapeze
In his B.V.D.s

He's got a union card and he's practicing hard
To play, the guitar, gonna be a big star
Yeah, he's gonna go far
And carry moonbeams home in a jar

He ordered Chet's guitar course, C.O.D.
Makes A and E and he's working on B
Digs C and W and R and B and me and the chimpanzees agree
That one day soon he'll be a celebrity

Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it

Gitarzan, he's a gitar man
He's all you can stand
Give him a hand, Gitarzan

He's got a girl named Jane with no last name
Kinda homely and plain but he loves her just the same
'Cause she kindles the flame and it drives him insane
When he hears her say, she really does her thing
It's her claim to fame, come on, sing one Jane

Baby, baby, oh baby
Baby, oh baby

How about that, let's hear for Jane, yeah
Thank you folks

Well, they've got a pet monkey, he likes to get drunk
And sing boogie woogie and it sounds real funky
Come on, your time boy, sing one monkey, you go

Let's hear it for the monkey, oh

On Saturday night they need some excitement
Jane gets right and the monkey gets tight
And their voices unite in the pale moonlight
And it sounds all right
Yeah, it's dynamite, it's out of sight
Let's hear it right now

Baby, baby, oh baby, baby
Shut up baby, I'm trying to sing
Baby

Get it, get it, get it, get it

Gitarzan and his jungle band
And they're all you can stand
Give him a hand, Gitarzan
Oh baby

Gitarzan and his jungle band
They're all you can stand
Give him a hand, Gitarzan
