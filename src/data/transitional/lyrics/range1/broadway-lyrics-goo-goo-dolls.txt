Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old mans bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday nights gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls

Forgotten but not gone
You drink it of your mind
You talk about the world
Like its someplace that youve been

You see youd love to run home
But you know you aint got one
'Cause youre livin in a world
That youre best forgotten around here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old mans bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues
When you're sober up for fun

Your anger dont impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell
On the losers day parade

You see youd love to run home
But you know you aint got one
Cause youre livin in a world
That youre best forgotten

When youre thinkin of a joke
And nobodys gonna listen
To one small point
I know they been missin round here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old mans bar
Waitin' for his turn to die

You see youd love to run home
But you know you aint got one
Cause youre livin in a world
That youre best forgotten

When youre thinkin of a joke
Do you think that theyll listen
To the one small point
I know they been missin round here, round here

Broadway is dark tonight
A little bit weaker
Than you used to be
Broadway is dark tonight

See the young man sittin'
In the old mans bar
Waitin' for his turn to die
