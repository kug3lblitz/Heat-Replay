It never really mattered to much to me
You were just too damned old for me
All that really mattered was you were my boyfriend
And baby, that's all that mattered to me
Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's got to be so right
Remember when you drove me home from work
I love the way when you kissed me bye
All of your friends think I'm just too young for you
You tell 'em I can do what girls their age can do
Oh baby, let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's got to be so right
Let me love you down
Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
You know it's got to be so right
It never really mattered to much to me
You were just too damned old for me
All that really mattered was you were my boyfriend
And baby, that's all that mattered to me
Oh baby, Let me love you down
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right
Let me love you down
Let me love you down
You know it's gonna be so right
I can love you down
Let me love you, let me love you
Let me love you down
I know, I know I could
Let me love you down
I know it's gonna take all night
Let me love you down
Let me love you down
Let me love c'mon [Incomprehensible]
Love you down down down down down
Love you down down down down down
I know, I know I could
Let me love you down
It's just you and me the whole night through
Let me love you baby
I know, I know I could
Love you down down
Let me love you
I know I could do baby
This so sweet to know
Let me love you down, oh baby
It's just you and me baby, the whole night through
So let me love you down
I can take this to much longer
