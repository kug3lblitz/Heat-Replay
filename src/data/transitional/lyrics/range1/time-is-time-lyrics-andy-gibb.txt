Time, it goes on, waits for nobody special
In the prime of my life I'll remember you
Livin' and breathin' and some misbelievin'
But I can't hold you women, no piece of you

You were the magic, my only believer
My life on the line for you, all that I give to you

Time is time, don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love, keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now, we capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right

Time, it goes on, waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistakin'
But I'll follow you women, eternally

You were the magic, my only believer
My life on the line for you, all that I give to you

Time is time, don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love, keep me alive to my dying day
Now is now, we capture the world
And love will make it all right, all right

Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love

Time is time, don't give me no wrong in makin' love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time, don't give me no wrong in makin' love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

Time is time, don't give me no wrong in makin' love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right
