You can just walk on, keep on

Sittin, waitin, anticipatin
Waiting for your call
Tossin, turnin, my heart's burnin
From the things I saw
I'm sorry baby, you can't play me
I just can't be used
I'm so fed up, time to get up
Baby we are through

BRIDGE:
I thought that what we had would never end
Now it's too late, my heart won't mend
And although what we had was good
I've got to make this understood

CHORUS:
Keep on walkin, I ain't talkin to you
Keep on walkin, keep on walkin (you can just go on)
Keep on walkin, I ain't talkin to you
Keep on walkin, keep on walkin (you can just go on)
We ain't talkin no more

I thought I told you it was over
Why are you confused?
Made your choice and now I'm voicing
My opinion to you
I think you're crazy
To try to play me for a foolish girl
You'll soon discover
You're not the only lover in this world

BRIDGE

CHORUS

You, you can just walk on
You, you can just keep on

BRIDGE

I know, I know, I know, I know it's just too late
I know, I know, I know, I know it's just too late

CHORUS

You can just go, you can just go, you can just go,
You can just go, you can just go, you can just go,
Oh oh oh oh yeah, Oh oh oh oh yeah (2x)
