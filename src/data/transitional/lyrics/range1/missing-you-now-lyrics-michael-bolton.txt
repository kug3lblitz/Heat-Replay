I talk to you but its not the same as touchin' you
And every time you whisper my name, I wanna run to you
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong

Baby 'cause I'm missing you now and its drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you baby, I'm missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you
Show you how I'm missing you now

Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
My arms around my pillow at night, they should be holdin' you
Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know
I can't take this much longer, so hard on my soul

Baby 'cause I'm missing you now and its drivin' me crazy
I got to be with you baby, I'm missing you now
I don't know what I'm gonna do
That's the way I'm missing you now

Baby I just can't wait, till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
Then and only then, will I be satisfied, missing you now

I know we'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever, and its hard to be strong

Baby 'cause I'm missing you now and its drivin' me crazy
I'm needin' you baby, missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you
Show you how I'm missing you

Missing you, missing you
Baby I should be holding you, caressing you
I just missing you now
I don't know what I'm gonna do
That's the way I'm missing you

Missing you, missing you now
It's drivin' me crazy
Oh I'm feeling you baby, I'm just missing you
