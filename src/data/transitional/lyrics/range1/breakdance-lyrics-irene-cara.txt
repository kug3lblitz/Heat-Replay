There was this new feeling coming out of the streets
Everybody's talkin' 'bout it wherever they meet
Down by the corner, keep getting the heat
Then my feet start moving to the rhythmic beat

Breakdancin'
Break out
Breakdancin'
Break out

They use to do the locomotion, do the jerk and the twist
But there just ain't never been nothin' like this
Now poppin' and knockin' is the new way of talkin'
There's a work at the shop, spinnin' out on the floor

Breakdancin'
Break out
Breakdancin'
Break out

Hearts are pumpin', beat is thumpin'
Love the way you're lookin' tonight
Fevers risin' no surprisin'
We won't have the time to fight
(Dance, dance, dance, dance, out, out, out, out)

Breakdancin'
Break out
Breakdancin'
Break out

Breakdancin'
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Break out
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Breakdancin'
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Break out
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Breakdancin'
(Rhythm in motion)
Break out
