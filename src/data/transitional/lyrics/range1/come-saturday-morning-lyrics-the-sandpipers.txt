Come Saturday morning, I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend till the end of the day, just I and my friend
We'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles and then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

Come Saturday morning, come Saturday morning

Come Saturday morning, I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-laugh more than half of the day, just I and my friend
(My friend)
Dressed up in our rings and our Saturday things and then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

Come Saturday morning, come Saturday morning

Come Saturday morning, just I and my friend
(Saturday, my friend)
We'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles and then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

Come Saturday morning, come Saturday morning
Come Saturday morning, come Saturday morning

Come Saturday morning, come Saturday morning
Come Saturday morning, come Saturday morning

Come Saturday morning, come Saturday morning
Come Saturday morning, come Saturday morning
