Ooh, baby

You give me the world, ooh
And everything that I've hoped for
Since I've been your girl
Oh, my whole life has been much better than ever before

You got a tender sweet love, yes you do
That weakens me and takes over me whenever we touch

Baby, that's just why I love you so much
Baby, that's just why I can't get enough
Baby, that's just why I love you so much
I love only you

Now, you say that you're down, oh
You said you won't play around, no, no, not with my heart
And when your boys come around
No you're not disrespectin' me and not tryin' to be Mr. Wanna-be-hard

You let them know that I'm yours, yes you do
By holdin' me and kissin' me, lets them know that for sure

Baby, that's just why I love you so much
Baby, that's just why I can't get enough
Baby, that's just why I love you so much
I love only you

Yes, you don't ever say I'm too young, thank you, baby
I've been around enough to know enough to know just what I want
You don't move too fast or make me rush, no
One day we're gonna talk about makin' love no doubt
Baby, when the time is right

Baby, that's just why I love you so much
Baby, that's just why I can't get enough
Baby, that's just why I love you so much
I love only you

Baby, no one else can do what you're doin' to me
You take me and you hold me
You run me in your arms, baby, and I love you for that, baby
You don't run in front of your friends
And you stand up and be a real man
And I love you and I love you and I love you for that, baby

Baby, that's just why I love you so much
Baby, that's just why I can't get enough
Baby, that's just why I love you so much
I love only you, yeah

Baby, that's just why I love you so much
Baby, that's just why I can't get enough
