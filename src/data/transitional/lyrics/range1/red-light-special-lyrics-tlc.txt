Take a good look at it
Look at it now
Might be the last time you'll
Have a go round

I'll let you touch it if you'd
Like to go down
I'll let you go further
If you take this southern route

Don't go too fast
Don't go too slow
You've got to let your body flow
I like 'em attentive
And I like 'em in control

Baby it's yours
(All yours)
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night

Baby it's yours
(All yours)
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

I know that you want me I can
See it in your eyes
You might as well be honest
'Cause the body never lies

Tell me your secrets and I'll
I'll tell you mine
I'm feelin' quite sexy
And I want you for tonight

If I move too fast
(Too fast)
Just let me know
(Just let me know)
'Cause it means you move too slow
I like some excitement
And I like a man that goes

Baby it's yours
(All yours)
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night

Baby it's yours
(All yours)
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
Take off my clothes
And turn on the red light

If you want me
Let me know it
I'll make time but
You've got to show it

If you need me
I want to see
But don't mistake me
I don't want you down on your knees

I need someone
(I need someone)
A real man
(A real man)
I need someone who understands
(Who understands)
I'm a woman
(I'm a woman)
A real woman
(A real woman)
I know just what I want
I know just who I am

Baby it's yours
(It's yours)
(All yours)
If you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special
All through the night

(Baby it's yours)
Baby it's yours
(All yours)
If you want it tonight
Just come through my door
(Just come through my door)
Take off my clothes
(Take off my clothes)
And turn on the red light

Baby it's yours
(All yours)
If you want it tonight
The red light special
All through the night
Baby it's yours
