What did you think I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me with tears in your eyes?
Trying to tell me that you have found you another
And you just don't love me no more

What did you think I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge that you just don't love me?
Did you think I would curse you or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more?

Did you think I could hate you or raise my hands to you?
Now come on, you know me too well
How could I hurt you when darling, I love you?
And you know I'd never hurt you, woah oh

What do you think I would give at this moment?
If you'd stay, I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees, kiss the ground
That you walk on, if I could just hold you again
