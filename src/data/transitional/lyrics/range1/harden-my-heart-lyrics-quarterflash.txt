Cryin' on the corner,
Waiting in the rain
I swear I'll never,
Ever wait again
You gave me your word..
But words for you are lies
Darlin' in my wildest dreams,
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know, oh

Chorus:
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn, and, leave you here

All of my life
I've been waiting in the rain
I've been waiting for a feeling
That never, ever came
It feels so close,
But always disappears
Darlin, in your wildest dreams,
You never had a clue.
But it's time you got the news

Repeat Chorus
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn, and, leave you here

Darlin' in my wildest dreams,
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know, oh
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna turn, and, leave you here

I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
Harden my heart.
I'm gonna swallow my tears
No Oh O O
Harden my heart
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
Harden my heart.
Harden my heart.
Swallow my tears
