Do me! Baby, do, do, do, do me! Baby
Do me! Baby, do me! Baby

Take a look at me
Tell me do you like what you see
Do you think you can?
Do you think you can do me?

Kiss me pretty baby
Touch me all over
Girl, what makes you think
You can do with me?

Do you think you, think you
Can do, do, do, do, do me

Do me! Baby, do me! Baby
Do me! Baby, do me! Baby

Girl, let your hair down
Take off your clothes and leave on your shoes
Would you mind if I looked
At you for a moment before I make sweet love?

Backstage, under age
Adolescent, how ya doin'?
Fine, she replied, I sighed
I like to do the wild thing

Action took place
Kinda wet, don't forget
The J, the I, the M, the M, the Y, y'all
I need a body bag

Do me! Baby, do me! Baby
Do me! Baby, do me! Baby

You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night

You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night

Do me! Baby

The time was 6 o'clock
On the Swatch watch
No time to chill, got a date
Can't be late

The girl is gonna do me
Move to the Jacuzzi, that booty
Smack it up, flip it
Rub it down, oh, no

Do me! Baby, do me! Baby
Do me! Baby, do me! Baby

Do me! Baby, do me! Baby
Do me! Baby, do me! Baby

You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me

You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me

Do me! Baby, do me! Baby
Do me! Baby, do me! Baby
Do me! Baby, do me! Baby

You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me

You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me

Do me! Baby, do me! Baby

You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you wanna do me
