Haha yeah, what up ma?
Yeah I know, I know
It's all good, Murder Inc

Girl your stare, those eyes, I love it when you look at me baby
Your lips, your smile, I love it when you kiss me baby
Your hips, those thighs, I love it when you thug me baby
And I can't deny, I love it when you shake it, hehe
Love it when I'm with you baby

I got a fetish with fucking you with the skirt on
On a back street in the back seat of a Yukon
What's taking so long? I'm getting extra impatient
Waiting for you to tell a nigga to move on

Between me and you we can find each other fly aboard in my private G2
I'm not trying to g you, I'm trying to see you bent over
You know how we do it, feet to shoulders bring heat to the coldest night So ferocious, promoting the dick game is poor

'Cause in the bed, nigga go hard like Jordan sweat pouring
Loving the way you be moaning, gripping
The sheets, looking at me, licking at me
'Cause every woman just want to be happy
It's crazy but baby, I love it when I'm with you baby

Girl your stare, those eyes, I love it when you look at me baby
Your lips, your smile, I love it when you kiss me baby
Your hips, those thighs, I love it when you thug me baby
And I can't deny, I love it when you shake it, hehe
Love it when I'm with you baby

I wanna get away, 'cause you know, like I know
And there's a better day coming
And I hooked on your lovin', believe me
And when you want my body

I know you need me, wait for me baby
I been going half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex is better then drugs
Making addictive boy listen

You're the only piece of the puzzle been missing
Like when you kissing
(Bye, bye, bye)
You got a girl that'll ride, ride, ride
So take me tonight and do what you do to me baby

Girl your stare, those eyes, I love it when you look at me baby
Your lips, your smile, I love it when you kiss me baby
Your hips, those thighs, I love it when you thug me baby
And I can't deny I love it when you shake it, hehe
Love it when I'm with you baby
