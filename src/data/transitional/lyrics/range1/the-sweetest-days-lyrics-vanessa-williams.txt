You and I, in this moment
Holding the night so close
Hanging on, still unbroken
While outside the thunder rolls

Listen now, you can hear our heartbeat
Warm against lifes bitter cold
These are the days
The sweetest days well know

There are times that scare me
Were rattle the house like a wind
Both of ours so unbending
We battle the fear within

All the while, life is rushing by us
Hold it now and dont let go
These are the days
The sweetest days well know

So well whisper a dream here in the darkness
Watching the stars till theyre gone
And when even the memories have all faded away
These days go on and on

Listen now, you can hear our heartbeat
Hold me now and dont let go
(These are the days)
Every day is the sweetest day well know

(These are the days)
The sweetest days well know
