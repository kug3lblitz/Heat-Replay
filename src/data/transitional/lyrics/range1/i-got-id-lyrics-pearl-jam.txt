My lips are shaking my nails are bit off.
Been a month since I've heard myself talk.
All the advantage this life's got on me.
Picture a coffin in the middle of the sea.

And I fight back in my mind. Never lets me be right.
I got memories. I got shit so much it don't show.

Oh, I walked the line when you held me in that night.
I walked the line when you held my hand that night.

An empty shell seems so easy to crack.
Got all these questions. Don't know who I could even ask.
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream where I'm not ugly and you're looking at me.

And I stay in bed. Oh, little I've seen there.
If just once I could feel love, oh, Stare back at me . Yeah.

But I walked the line when you held me in that night.
Oh, I walked the line when you held my hand that night.
Oh, I walked the line when you held me close that night.
I paid the price. Never held you in real life.
My lips are shaking...
