Someone, someone's done you wrong
You thought that your love was strong
Now you're feelin' like such a fool
You're thinkin' maybe if you said goodbye
You'll understand the reason why
The love you had felt so cruel, um-hm

Oh, but it's all right once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way

Sometimes we all feel a need to change
Our love we have to rearrange
And move on to something new, yes you do
Your dreams feel like they're fallin' apart
You need to find a brand new start
But you're almost afraid to be true to yourself

Oh, but it's all right once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way
Love will find a way, love will find a way

So now don't, don't be afraid of yourself
Just move on to something else
And let your love shine through again

Yes, 'cause it's all right once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way

Oh, but it's all right once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
'Cause love will find a way
