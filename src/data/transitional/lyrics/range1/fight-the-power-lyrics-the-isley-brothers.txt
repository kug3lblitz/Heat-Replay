Time is truly wastin'
There's no guarantee
Smile's in the makin'
You gotta fight the powers that be

Got so many forces
Stayin' on the scene
Givin' up all around me
Faces full a' pain

I try to play my music
They say my music's too loud
I tried talkin' about it
I got the big run around
And when I rolled with the punches
I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down

Time is truly wastin'
There's no guarantee
Smile's in the makin'
You gotta fight the powers that be

I don't understand it
People wanna see
Those that got the answers
Red tape in the way

I could take you in easy
That's just half the fun, oh boy
Seeking satisfaction
Keeps me on the run

I try to play my music
They say my music's too loud
I tried talkin' about it
I got the big run around
And when I rolled with the punches
I got knocked on the ground
But all this bullshit going down

Time is truly wastin'
There's no guarantee
Smile's in the makin'
You gotta fight the powers that be
Got it baby

If you and I can
We got the power
Fight it, got the power
Fight it, baby, baby
Fight it, fight the power

Fight it, got the power
Fight it, got the power
Fight it, got the power
