Ooh, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of her room
Hides a smile when she's wearin' a frown
Ooh, Jackie you're not so down

You like your life in a free-form style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Floating around to fill your lovin' cup

Ooh, Jackie Blue
What's a game girl, if you never lose?
Ask a winner and you'll probably find
Ooh, Jackie they've lost at sometime

Don't try to tell me that you're not aware
Of what you're doing and that you don't care
You say it's easy, just a natural thing
Like playing music, but you never sing

Ooh, Jackie Blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places that you've never been
Ooh, Jackie Blue, you're going again

Ooh, Jackie Blue
Lives a dream that can never come true
Making love is like sifting through sand
Ooh, Jackie, it slips through your hand

Every day, in your indigo eyes
I watch the sunset but I don't see it rise
Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine
You'd take the world but you won't take the time

Ooh-hoo-hoo, Jackie Blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Makes you think that her life is a drag
Ooh Jackie, what fun you have had

Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Ooh, Jackie
Hey, hey, hey, hey
