When I get home from work
Wanna wrap myself around you
I wanna take you and squeeze you
Till the passion starts to rise

I wanna take you to heaven
That would make my day complete
But you and me ain't no movie stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed, some lovin' and TV, yeah

And that's enough for a workin' man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you, babe
Well, that's enough for me

Sometimes when you're asleep
And I'm just starin' at the ceiling
I wanna reach out and touch you
But you just go on dreamin'

If I could take you to heaven
That would make my day complete
'Cause you and me ain't no movie stars
What we are is what we are
I tell you sweetheart that's just enough for me

You and me ain't no super stars
What we are is what we are
We share a bed, popcorn and TV, yeah

But that's enough for a workin' man
What I am is what I am
And I tell you, babe
You're just enough for me

When I get home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I like to hold you squeeze you
Till the passion starts to rise

I wanna take you to heaven
That would make my day complete
