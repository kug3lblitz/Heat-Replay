I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush
That I just did not want
Paid was the issue of the day
If my girlfriends got some game
Couldn't be more fly
Gettin' paid was everything

But I'm not every girl
And I don't need that world to validate me
'Cause Shorty got a job, Shorty got a car
And Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost
How much he spent on me
Seek for a man who's got the means
To be giving you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl
Could want or even dream

But I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G to care of me
'Cause Shorty got a job, Shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no, no

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

But I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G to take care of me, no
'Cause Shorty got a job, Shorty got a car
And Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I, I just want real love
Said I gotta have real love
Everything can, you be everything that I dream of
