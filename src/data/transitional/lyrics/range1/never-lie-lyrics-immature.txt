Friends come a dime a dozen
And I know that I'll never find a friend like you
And that's why I wanna sing this song
Wherever you are, I just want to let you know
That I'll never lie to you again, I promise

I will never lie again
'Cause you will always be my friend
I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you will last forever

Sitting in my window, thinking of you
All the fun things we use to do
I feel the pain, please come back to me
'Cause a friend like you will only
Come once in a lifetime

I will never lie again
'Cause you will always be my friend
I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you will last forever

On the phone when you were here
Laughing and joking, cryin' and sulkin'
In my dreams you're still with me
'Cause a friend like you will only
Come once in a lifetime

I will never lie again
'Cause you will always be my friend
I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you will last forever

When I think of you, I think of someone special
And how it used to be
I know you'll always be my friend
I'm so sad it had to end, oh yeah, baby

I will never lie again
'Cause you will always be my friend
I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you will last forever

I will never lie again
'Cause you'll always be my friend
I will never lie again
'Cause a friend like you will last forever
I will never lie again
