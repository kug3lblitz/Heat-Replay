I wanna know
Who ever told you I was letting go
The only joy that I have ever known
Girl, they're lying

Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Have just given up, they wanna let it go
But we're still trying

So you should know this love we share
Was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one way street
Just you and I, just you and I

I'm never gonna say, "Goodbye"
'Coz I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again
And I, I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Coz I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again, all over again

Some people say that
"Everything has got it's place in time"
Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buying

'Coz in your eyes
I see a love that burns eternally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You'll know I'm not lying

Sure there'll be times we wanna say, "Goodbye"
But even if we try
There are something's in this life won't be denied
Won't be denied

I'm never gonna say, "Goodbye"
'Coz I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again
And I, I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Coz I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

The more I know of you
Is the more I know I love you
And the more that I'm sure
I want you forever and ever more
And the more that you love me
The more that I know
Ho that I'm never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know that I

I'm never gonna say, "Goodbye"
'Coz I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again
And I, I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Coz I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

All over again
All over again
And I swear it all over again
