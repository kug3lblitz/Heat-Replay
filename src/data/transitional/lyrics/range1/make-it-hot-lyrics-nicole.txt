But uh anyway
You could catch me any day
Sippin' Hennessey
And my peeps get plenty way
But anyways to see that I hold this dough
Cats fake it, I made it
I told you so

Mocha Latte
We no play, stress free
Sexy and Montego bay
You know it's a pity that
Y'all look like idiots
Yo boo let me know
When I should rip this cat

My man, he don't call me anymore
We don't even kiss
Am I his fool?
What must I do
To keep him loving me?
All this love I give
That ain't cool

I got what you want
(Got what you want)
I got what you need
(I got what you need)
Can I get another shot?
This time I'm a make it hot

I got what you want
(Got what you need, baby)
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'm a make it hot

I call my man at the crib
He turned off his phone
Said to call him back
Why silly me?
Why didn't I suspect
He was makin' love to someone else
Boy you killin' me

I got what you want
(Got what you want)
I got what you need
(I got what you need )
Can I get another shot?
This time I'm a make it hot

I got what you want
(Got what you want)
I got what you need
(I got what you need)
Can I get another shot?
This time I'm a make it hot

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

I got what you want
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'm a make it hot

I got what you want
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
This time I'm a make it

I'm sittin' on the side of the curb
With a pocket of herb
I don't know if y'all heard
I'm high as a bird
I can fly like Kelly
I can glide like skates
Me with no Timbaland
Is like Puff with no Mase

Wait, hold up
Wait a minute, what you say
Back it up, give me space
Who that, Nicole Ray
By the way DJ, better play all day
Make the whole world say damn this sucker Ray

Yo yo yo
Yeah this be the jump
That's makin' everybody wanna bop their heads
Haters, lovers, whatever
Nicole Ray
Timbaland
Maa-Goo
Aaliyah
Ginuwine
Missy
Playa

I got what you want
(I got what you want)
I got what you need
Can I get another shot?
(Yes you can)
This time I'm a make it hot
(Oh really)

I got what you want
(Do you?)
I got what you need
(I think you do)
Can I get another shot?
(Oh yes you can)
This time I'm a make it hot
(Really)
