You're soldiers of God, you must understand
The fate of your country is in your young hands
May God give you strength, do your job real well
If it all was worth it, only time it will tell

In the morning they return with tears in their eyes
The stench of death drifts up to the skies
A young soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot
Remembers the words, 'Thou shalt not kill'

Sky pilot, sky pilot, how high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
Sky pilot, sky pilot, how high can you fly?
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
You'll never, never, never reach the sky
