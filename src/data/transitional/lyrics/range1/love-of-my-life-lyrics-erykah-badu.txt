Right here what we gon' do is go back
Way back
Way back, yeah

I met him when I was a
Little girl, he gave me
He gave me poetry
And he was my first

But in my heart I knew I
Wasn't the only one
Cause when the tables turned
He had to break up

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the

Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
I can depend
Love of my life
Without you, baby
It feels like a simple true love

Hope this shit ain't clear
A freak-freak ya'll, and ya don't stop
To the beat ya'll and ya don't stop
A freak-freak

Or could it be that it was
All just so simple then
A teenage lover who said
He's just a friend

He moved around and we kept
In touch through his friend Mike
The world was young and he knew
We couldn't rush but

Whenever I got lonely
Or needed some advice
He gave me his shoulder
His words were very nice

But that is all behind me
Cause now there is no other
My love is his and his is mine
A friend became the

Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
A dude I can depend, yeah, yeah
Love of my life
Feels like a simple true love, yeah

Love of my life
You are my friend
Love of my life
A dude I can depend, yeah, yeah
Love of my life
Feels like a simple true love, yeah

Hope this shit ain't clear

To grow I had to let her (let her)
