We walked to the sea, just my father and me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air, hanging still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say, "Hold my hand?"

I said, "Love's easier when it's far away"
We sat and watched a distant light

We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say, It's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

There's a boat on the line, where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers
A wide ways apart as we drift on through time

He said, It's harder now, we're far away
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say, It's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We're those ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say, It's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We're just two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say, It's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
