You ain't crazy, I ain't gonna lie anymore
What you're feelin', there's a reason for
I wanna do right, oh, I gotta do right
Do I love you? Oh, you know I've tried
But what you're after, you can't find in my eyes
I wanna do right

Darlin', tell the truth, don't turn away
This is our last chance
To touch each others hearts

Does anything last forever?
I don't know, maybe we're near the end
So darlin' oh, how can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

One by one, we're collecting lies
When you can't give love, you give alibis
Now, I'm gonna do right, this time I gotta do right
I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna say goodbye
But sooner or later, there comes a time
When you gotta do right, come on, come on

Darlin', tell the truth, don't turn away
From this final chance
To touch each others hearts

Does anything last forever?
I don't know, maybe we're near the end
So darlin' oh, how can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

(Why are you so torn apart?)
I need a little more lovin' in my heart
(People say that love will grow)
So how was I to know
Love that's come through years and years
Can't find a way back home, anymore

Darlin', tell me the truth, don't turn away
This is our final chance
To touch each others hearts

Does anything last forever?
I don't know, maybe we're near the end
So darlin' oh, how can we go on together
Now that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

Does anything last forever?
I don't know, maybe we're near the end
So darlin' oh, how can we go on together
Now, that we've grown apart
Well, the only way to start
Is heart to heart

I know the only way to start
This time is heart to heart
