Now I'm living in the middle of a dream
A dream with a little bit of fantasy

Dreamin', dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin'

For the life of me, I never thought that it could be
The way it stands right now
Emotions running high, every night I wish that I
I would tell you how I feel

Those words are here in my heart
Oh, but there is just one missing part
How to put it together? How to say it right?
And let you know that every night

I'll be dreamin', dreamin'
Hopin' baby you will be there
I'll be dreamin', dreamin'
Hopin' baby you will be there

Let me take time out to try and find out
If this could be real
'Cause reality scares me, I've been living a fantasy
How should I feel?

Those words are here in my heart
Oh, but there is just one missing part
How to put it together? How to say it right?
And let you know that every night

I'll be dreamin', dreamin'
Hopin' baby you will be there
I'll be dreamin', dreamin'
Hopin' baby you will be there

Those words are here in my heart
But there is just one missing part
How to put it together? How to say it right?
And let you know that every night

I'll be dreamin', I'll be dreamin'
I'll be dreamin', I'll be dreamin'
I keep on dreamin' 'bout you every night
I'm dreamin' 'bout you every night
Make you all mine

Now I'm living in the middle of a dream
A dream with a little bit of fantasy
Now I'm living in the middle of a dream
A dream with a little bit of fantasy
I wanna dream till I make you mine

Now I'm living in the middle of a dream
A dream with a little bit of fantasy
Hopin' baby, hopin' baby you will be there
Now I'm living in the middle of a dream
A dream with a little bit of fantasy
I wanna dream till I make you mine

Now I'm living in the middle of a dream
A dream with a little bit of fantasy
