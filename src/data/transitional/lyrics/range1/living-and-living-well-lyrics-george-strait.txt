Had a nice little life
A little boat, a little beach, a little routine I liked
A blue ocean view, free to go with the flow anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore that's when I knew

There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all, all by yourself
Something's always missing 'til you share it with someone else
And there's a difference in living and living well

'Til you sailed with me, thought that I had it good as good as it could be
From the back of my deck caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw the best one yet

There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all, all by yourself
Something's always missing 'til you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you

There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all, all by yourself
Something's always missing 'til you share it with someone else

There's a difference in living
I thought I was living
There's a difference in living and living well
Living well, I'm living well
