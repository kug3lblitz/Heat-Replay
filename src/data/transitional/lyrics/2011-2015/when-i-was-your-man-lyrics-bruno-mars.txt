Same bed but it feels just
A little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio
But it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you
All it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little
When I hear your name
It all just sounds like (oooooh)
Mmm too young too dumb to realize
That i

Should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But she's dancing with another man

In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Bruno told the mag that "When I Was Your Man" was written about a rocky patch in his relationship with model Jessicaâ¦	


See all



My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never never get to clean up the mess I made
Ooh and it hunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like (oooooh)
Mmm too young too dumb to realize
That I

Should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing
But she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say
That I was wrooooong
Oooh I know i'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember how much
You loved to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
