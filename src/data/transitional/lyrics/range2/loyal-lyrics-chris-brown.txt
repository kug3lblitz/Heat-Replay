Young Mula, baby

I woke up all last night
I know this h*** ain't right
But you was blowin' up her phone last night
But she ain't have a ringer nor her ring on last night ooh
N****, that's that nerve
Why give a b**** your heart? when she rather have a purse
Why give a b**** your inch? when she rather have nine
You know how the game go she be mine, 'bout half time, I'm the s***, ooh
N****, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this b**** no flamingos
And I've done everything but trust these h***, C.B. f*** wit' me!

When I rich n**** want you
And your n**** can do nothing for ya
Oh these h*** ain't loyal
Whoa these h*** ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke n**** b****
I can make a broke b**** rich
But I don't f*** with broke b****es
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the Bay with me
Eyes closed, smoking marijuana
Rolling up the bar, molly I'm a rockstar
She wanna do drugs, smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a n**** trapped
She wanna f*** all the rappers

When I rich n**** want you (Want you babe)
And your n**** can't do nothing for ya (Nothin' oh)
Oh these h*** ain't loyal (No they ain't)
Whoa these h*** ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad b****, let's get to it (Right away)
We up in this club, bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this b**** with your man
That's a no no girl
All is funny in the air
I wanna see you dance

Just got rich
Took a broke n**** b****
I can make a broke b**** rich
But I don't f*** with broke b****es

When I rich n**** want you (Want you babe)
And your n**** can't do nothing for ya (No nothin' no)
Oh these h*** ain't loyal (Oh no)
Whoa these h*** ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me see

With Ciroc in the system?
Ain't no tellin' will I f***, 'em or will I diss 'em
That's what they be yelling, I'm a pimp by blood
No relation, I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
LVs, Hermes, Dolces
Them h*** ain't loyal, they rotatin'
School me to the game, now I'm on my duty
Put it her in the Lotus she was riding in that hooptie

Got my own smoke
Had to put my mink back on
Tell that b**** put a ring back on, Montana

Come on, come on, girl why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
You don' spent bread on her
And it's all for nothing

When I rich n**** want you (Want you babe)
And your n**** can't do nothing for ya (Can't do nothin' for you)
Oh these h*** ain't loyal (Oh no)
Whoa these h*** ain't loyal
