[Pharrell Williams Vocals]

Like the legend of the Phoenix,
All ends with beginnings.
What keeps the planets spinning,
The force from the beginning.

[Pre-Chorus:]
We've come too far
To give up who we are,
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars.

[Chorus:]
She's up all night till the sun,
I'm up all night to get some.
She's up all night for good fun,
I'm up all night to get lucky.

We're up all night till the sun,
We're up all night to get some.
We're up all night for good fun,
We're up all night to get lucky.

[Post-Chorus:]
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.

The present has no ribbon,
Your gift keeps on giving.
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave, I'm with it.

[All Chorus]

[Daft Punk Bridge:]
We're up all night to get...
We're up all night to get...
We're up all night to get...
We're up all night to get...

We're up all night to get
We're up all night (let's get back again).
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get luck

We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.
We're up all night to get lucky.

[All Chorus]
