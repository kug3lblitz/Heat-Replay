I heard about you
You heard about me?
Haha, yeah, what, haha
Cause I had some issues
Back at ya, bad girl

Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck I'll be your
Bad girl, I'll prove it to you
Can't promise that, I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did
But I sure know how to fuck ya, I be

Yeah hold up, bad girls ain't no good,
And the good girls ain't no fun
Look (And the bad girls want a real nigga!)
Yeah, cause real niggas just want (ha)
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing
Got a thing for a queen who don't wanna leave
You got a (thing for a king, but you ain't a king)
Seems like the ones who roll never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)
Yeah in the literal sense, I mean the physical sense
I mean the, oops, wait, let me give me a second
I need a minute to vent, I'm only telling you that I heard you (bad girl)
And I'm tellin' you I could believe that
Not the type of fella to yell or be gettin' jealous
But we talkin' 'bout game, Wale got the league pass
We at that bed, floor, couch, hold up
(Loud, pack, boy, roll up)
You know what's up? (Whats up?)
Forget it, 'cause you know the bad girls always unapologetic

Is it bad that, I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck I'll be your
Bad girl, I'll prove it to you
Can't promise that, I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you

She hurt feelings, she ain't wrong
She work hard, she play harder
Got a smart mouth, like a speed fly
She don't catch feelings she too busy catching G5
She no saint, 'cept Saint Laurent
Gone blaze up, take the wheel Jah
And Rhianna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya
Never did terrible bullshit ya
Enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost (Cause I've had some issues)
Yeah and I noticed it
You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion
Psh get over here today
Smellin' like Jean Paul, got the ye
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them
Ain't no IG, but she follow K
And we at that bed, floor, couch, hold up
(Loud, pack, boy, roll up)
You know what's up? (Whats up?)
Forget it, all these bad bitches always unapologetic

Is it bad that, I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck I'll be your
Bad girl, I'll prove it to you
Can't promise that, I'll be good to you
'Cause I had some issues, I won't commit, no not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad no to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed, but I'll be bad to you (bad to you)
